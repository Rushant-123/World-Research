# TSMC - The World's Leading Chip Manufacturer

TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) is the world's largest and most advanced dedicated semiconductor foundry, producing chips for Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, and virtually every major tech company.

## Business Model

TSMC operates a pure-play foundry model—they manufacture chips designed by other companies but don't design or sell their own chips. This neutral position makes them the trusted partner for competitors like Apple and Qualcomm.

## Market Position

- **54% global foundry market share** (2024)
- **90% of advanced chips** (5nm and smaller) produced by TSMC
- Only company mass-producing **3nm chips** at scale
- **$40B annual capex** investment in new fabs and equipment

## Revenue Drivers

TSMC's revenue is dominated by **advanced technology nodes**:

- **60% from 7nm and below** - Apple A-series, M-series chips, Nvidia H100 AI GPUs, AMD Ryzen processors
- **27% from 16-28nm** - Automotive chips, IoT devices, consumer electronics
- **11% from mature nodes** - Power management, analog circuits, legacy products

Their biggest customers are:
1. **Apple** (25% of revenue) - iPhone and Mac processors
2. **Nvidia** (11% of revenue) - AI and gaming GPUs
3. **AMD** (8% of revenue) - Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs
4. **MediaTek** (7% of revenue) - Smartphone chips
5. **Qualcomm** (6% of revenue) - Snapdragon processors

## Cost Structure

TSMC's largest expense is **manufacturing equipment and operations** (45% of costs):

- **EUV lithography machines** from ASML cost $380M each, TSMC operates 100+
- **Cleanroom operations** - Class 1 cleanrooms with 24/7 operations
- **Wafer fabrication** - 3 million wafer starts per month across 13 fabs

**R&D spending** (15%) focuses on pushing Moore's Law:
- 3nm production ramped in 2023
- 2nm development for 2025
- 1.4nm research with gate-all-around transistors
- Exploring 3D chip stacking and chiplets

**Energy consumption** is massive (9% of costs):
- 7.5% of Taiwan's total electricity
- Building dedicated renewable energy plants
- Water usage: 160,000 tons per day requiring advanced recycling

## Strategic Advantages

1. **Technology leadership** - 2+ years ahead of Samsung, 5+ years ahead of Intel
2. **Manufacturing expertise** - Highest yields in the industry (90%+ on mature nodes)
3. **Customer trust** - Neutral foundry model prevents competition
4. **Scale economics** - Massive volume spreads R&D costs
5. **Taiwan clustering** - Deep supply chain integration with equipment vendors

## Challenges

- **Geopolitical risk** - 90% of production in Taiwan
- **Arizona fab** being built ($40B investment) for US customers
- **Customer concentration** - Apple alone is 25% of revenue
- **Massive capex** - $40B+ annual investment to maintain leadership
- **Energy constraints** - Taiwan's power grid limiting fab expansion

TSMC's dominance in advanced chip manufacturing makes them arguably the most important company in the global technology supply chain—without TSMC, modern AI, smartphones, and data centers couldn't exist at current performance levels.
