# Freeport-McMoRan - World's Largest Copper Producer

Freeport-McMoRan is the world's largest publicly traded copper producer and one of the largest gold producers, operating major mines in North and South America and Indonesia.

## Business Model

Freeport operates large-scale open-pit and underground mines extracting copper, gold, and molybdenum. Their flagship Grasberg mine in Indonesia is one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits.

## Market Position

- **28% of global publicly traded copper production** (2024)
- **#1 copper producer** in North America
- **4.4 billion pounds** of copper produced annually
- **7 major mining operations** across 4 countries

## Revenue Drivers

Copper dominates Freeport's business at **70% of revenue**:

### Copper (70% - $16B)
- **Electronics demand** - Circuit boards, wiring, connectors for all electronics
- **Electric vehicles** - 183 lbs of copper per EV vs 48 lbs per gas car
- **Renewable energy** - Wind turbines, solar panels, grid infrastructure
- **Construction** - Building wiring, plumbing, HVAC systems
- **Price leverage** - Every $0.10/lb change in copper price = $440M revenue impact

### Gold (21% - $4.8B)
- **Byproduct advantage** - Gold extracted alongside copper at minimal incremental cost
- **Market hedge** - Gold prices often move inversely to economy, balancing copper exposure
- **High margin** - Incremental gold revenue is nearly pure profit

### Molybdenum (9% - $2.1B)
- **Steel alloy** - Strengthens steel for oil pipelines, reactors, jet engines
- **Lubricant additive** - Industrial and automotive applications

## Cost Structure

### Mining Operations (57% - $13.1B)

Freeport's largest cost is extracting and processing ore:

**Extraction:**
- **Drilling & blasting** - Create 50-ton explosive charges, fragment ore bodies
- **Loading** - Electric rope shovels load 300-400 ton haul trucks
- **Transport** - Haul ore 2-5 miles from pit bottom to crusher
- **Overburden removal** - Move 3 tons of waste for every ton of ore

**Processing:**
- **Crushing** - Reduce 1500mm boulders to <300mm
- **Grinding** - SAG mills and ball mills grind to 150 microns
- **Flotation** - Chemical separation concentrates 0.4% ore to 25-35% concentrate
- **Tailings** - Manage waste slurry, water reclamation

### Labor & Equipment (20% - $4.6B)

- **24,500 employees** - Miners, engineers, geologists, support staff
- **Heavy equipment fleet:**
  - 400-ton haul trucks ($5M each, 50+ at major mines)
  - Electric rope shovels ($45M each)
  - Ball mills ($80M each for SAG/ball mill combo)
- **Maintenance** - Continuous repair on equipment operating 24/7 in harsh conditions

### Energy & Transport (13% - $3B)

Massive energy requirements:

- **Diesel fuel** - Haul trucks consume 130 gallons/hour, operating 24/7
- **Electricity** - Grinding mills, crushing, flotation = 30-40% of operating costs
- **Grasberg mine** uses 650 MW (enough to power a city of 500,000)
- **Shipping** - Copper concentrate transported by rail and ship to smelters worldwide

## Key Mining Operations

1. **Grasberg (Indonesia)** - World's 2nd largest copper deposit, largest gold deposit
2. **Morenci (Arizona)** - North America's largest copper mine, 900M lbs/year
3. **Cerro Verde (Peru)** - One of world's largest open-pit copper mines
4. **El Abra (Chile)** - Major oxide and sulfide copper production

## Strategic Advantages

1. **Long-lived assets** - Mines with 30-100+ year reserves
2. **Vertical integration** - Own mines, concentrators, and some smelting
3. **Byproduct credits** - Gold and molybdenum reduce net copper cost
4. **Scale economics** - Massive operations spread fixed costs
5. **Grade advantage** - Higher copper grades than competitors (0.4% vs 0.3% average)

## Market Dynamics

Copper demand is accelerating:

- **Electrification** - EVs and renewable energy driving 30%+ demand growth
- **Supply shortage** - No major new mines coming online, existing mines depleting
- **China dependency** - 55% of global copper demand from China
- **Price volatility** - Copper swings $2-5/lb, massively impacting profitability

## Challenges

- **Declining grades** - Ore quality decreasing as mines age
- **Water scarcity** - Milling requires massive water volumes in desert regions
- **Social license** - Community relations, environmental impact, indigenous rights
- **Geopolitical risk** - Major assets in politically unstable regions
- **Capital intensity** - $1-2B to develop new mines, 10+ year payback

Freeport-McMoRan sits at a critical juncture in the technology supply chain—without copper, modern electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy infrastructure simply cannot be built. Their mines literally power the electrification of civilization.
