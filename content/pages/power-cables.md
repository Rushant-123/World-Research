# How to Make AC Power Cable

Mains power cord supplying 120V AC (North America) or 230V AC (Europe/Asia/Oceania) electricity from wall outlet to device. Mac power adapters use detachable 3-conductor cables: Line (hot), Neutral, Ground (safety). Standard types: C5 "Mickey Mouse" (3-prong laptop), C13 (IEC 60320, desktop/monitor), NEMA 1-15P (USA 2-prong), NEMA 5-15P (USA 3-prong grounded). Construction: stranded copper conductors (14-18 AWG), PVC or rubber insulation, molded plug with brass pins. Rated 10-15A, 125-250V. Global production: 2+ billion power cords/year.

**Step 1-15: [Copper Wire](copper-wire) Conductor Manufacturing**
Electrolytic tough pitch (ETP) copper rod 99.9% Cu, 8mm diameter. Wire drawing: heat copper rod to 500-650°C (anneal, soften crystal structure, reduce work hardening). Draw through tungsten carbide dies (progressive size reduction, 8mm → 1.5mm for 16 AWG, 10-15 drawing passes, each pass 15-25% reduction). Lubrication: drawing compound (soap, oil) reduces friction, cools wire, prevents die wear. Intermediate annealing: every 4-6 passes, 200-400°C hydrogen or nitrogen atmosphere (prevent oxidation), restore ductivity (elongation 20-30%). Final wire diameter: (1) 18 AWG: 1.024mm (2.5A capacity, lamp cords, low-power devices). (2) 16 AWG: 1.291mm (10A, most laptop power cords, 1,250W at 125V). (3) 14 AWG: 1.628mm (15A, desktop computers, monitors, 1,875W at 125V). **Stranding:** Multiple thin wires twisted into single conductor (increases flexibility, fatigue resistance vs solid wire). Common: 16/30 (16 strands of 30 AWG), 26/34 (26 strands 34 AWG for 18 AWG result), 41/36 (41×36 for 16 AWG). Stranding machine: pay-off reels feed individual wires, tubular or planetary strander twists (5-10 twists per inch, right-hand lay). Strand annealing: 200-300°C (final temper, conductivity 100% IACS minimum per UL 758). Tinning (optional): dip stranded conductor in molten tin-lead (63/37) or lead-free tin (99.3% Sn) at 230-260°C (prevents oxidation, improves solder, extends life - common in marine/harsh environments, adds cost $0.05-0.10/meter).

**Step 16-35: Insulation Extrusion with [PVC](pvc-polymer) Compound**
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) insulation: flame-retardant, flexible, low-cost dielectric. **PVC formulation:** Base resin (PVC homopolymer K-value 65-70, 100 parts by weight), plasticizer (dioctyl phthalate DOP or diisononyl phthalate DINP, 30-50 parts, softens polymer, flexibility), stabilizer (calcium-zinc or organotin, 2-5 parts, prevents HCl degradation, heat stability), filler (calcium carbonate CaCO₃, 5-20 parts, reduces cost, improves extrusion), flame retardant (antimony trioxide Sb₂O₃ 3-8 parts, synergizes with chlorine in PVC, self-extinguishing), colorants (carbon black 2-4 parts for black, TiO₂ for white). **Compounding:** Mix ingredients in high-intensity mixer (100-120°C, 5-15 minutes, frictional heating melts/blends components). Extrude compound through die, cool, pelletize (3-5mm pellets). **Insulation extrusion:** Extruder (single-screw or twin-screw, 60mm diameter, L/D ratio 24:1), feed hopper receives PVC pellets. Barrel zones heat progressively (zone 1: 140°C, zone 2: 160°C, zone 3: 180°C, die: 170-190°C). Screw rotates (60-120 RPM), conveys, melts, mixes, meters polymer. **Crosshead die:** Conductor (stranded copper) passes through center, molten PVC flows from extruder into crosshead, coats wire concentrically. Die gap sets insulation thickness (0.6-1.5mm for 16-18 AWG, meets UL 62 thickness requirements). Extrudate exits die at 180-200°C. **Cooling trough:** Water bath (15-25°C, 3-10 meter length), solidifies PVC insulation (glass transition Tg 80-100°C, solidifies <60°C). Haul-off caterpillar puller: rubber belts grip insulated wire, pull at constant speed (10-50 m/min, synchronize with extrusion rate, maintain tension 2-10 kg). **Spark tester:** High-voltage electrode (1-3 kV DC) touches moving insulated wire, detects pinholes (breakdown → spark triggers reject alarm). **Capstan/take-up reel:** Wind insulated conductor (1,000-3,000 meter reels).

**Step 36-58: Color-Coded Insulation and Multi-Conductor Assembly**
Power cords require 2-3 insulated conductors (electrical code color standards). **North America (NEMA):** Line (hot, black insulation), Neutral (white or gray), Ground (green or green/yellow stripe). **Europe/International (IEC):** Line (brown), Neutral (blue), Ground (green/yellow). **Japan:** Line (black or brown), Neutral (white), Ground (green). Extrude each conductor separately with color-coded PVC (add pigments: carbon black, TiO₂ white, iron oxide brown, chromium oxide green). **Cable assembly:** Bundle conductors in parallel (flat configuration, 2-wire polarized) or triangular/round (3-wire grounded). **Cabling machine:** Pay-off reels hold 3 insulated conductor reels, conductors feed together, helical lay (optional, 10-20 twists/meter, prevents separation, improves flexibility). Alternatively: parallel untwisted (flat lamp cord style, cheaper, less flexible). **Filler/separator:** Some designs include paper or plastic web separator between conductors (maintains spacing, prevents shorts during bending). **Adhesion (optional):** Apply talc or silicone-based release agent between conductors (prevents PVC from sticking during jacketing, allows individual conductor movement - improves flexibility, reduces stress).

**Step 59-78: Outer Jacket Extrusion with [Rubber](synthetic-rubber) or PVC**
Protective jacket over insulated conductors: mechanical protection, moisture barrier, flame retardant. **Materials:** (1) PVC jacket compound (similar to insulation formulation, shore A hardness 75-95, less plasticizer = harder/more abrasion resistant). (2) Synthetic rubber: styrene-butadiene rubber SBR, chloroprene (Neoprene), thermoplastic elastomer TPE (superior flexibility, cold temperature performance –40°C, oil resistance, higher cost $0.50-1.00/meter premium). (3) Thermoplastic rubber TPR (recyclable, halogen-free, environmentally friendly, meets RoHS/REACH). **Jacket extrusion:** Second extruder line (larger diameter 90-120mm screw, temperatures 160-220°C for PVC, 180-240°C for TPE/TPR). Crosshead die: 3-conductor assembly passes through center, molten jacket polymer coats entire cable. Jacket thickness: 0.8-2.0mm (UL 62, IEC 60227 standards specify minimum based on cable OD). Final cable OD: 6-10mm (18 AWG 2-conductor), 7-12mm (16 AWG 3-conductor). **Extrusion rate:** 20-100 m/min (slower than single conductor, thicker jacket requires longer cooling). **Cooling:** Water trough (10-20 meters long, cold water 10-20°C, jacket solidifies, dimensional stability). **Diameter measurement:** Laser micrometer (continuous monitoring, ±0.1mm tolerance, feedback to extruder speed controller, maintain uniform OD). **Print/marking:** Inkjet printer or hot-stamp applies text on jacket surface (manufacturer name, voltage rating, wire gauge, certification marks "UL", "CSA", "VDE", "CCC", country of origin, sequential meter marks every 0.5-1.0 meter). **Coiling:** Wind finished cable on reels (500-1,000m industrial reels) or cut to length (1-3 meter consumer cables, automatic cutter).

**Step 79-100: [AC Plug Molding](thermoplastic-molding) - Housing and Pins**
**Plug housing material:** Thermoplastic (PVC, polycarbonate PC, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS, polypropylene PP, nylon PA6/PA66). Requirements: UL94 V-0 or V-2 flame rating (self-extinguishing, <10 seconds burn time, no flaming drips), dielectric strength >3 kV/mm, impact resistance, heat deflection temperature >70-90°C. **Injection molding:** (1) Dry resin pellets (moisture <0.02%, prevents voids/bubbles). (2) Inject into heated barrel (180-280°C depending on resin, polycarbonate 280-310°C, ABS 200-250°C, nylon 250-290°C). (3) Screw rams molten plastic into closed mold (two-piece steel mold, cavity shaped as plug housing, 50-150 MPa injection pressure, 2-10 seconds injection time). (4) Holding pressure (30-60 seconds, compensate shrinkage as plastic cools). (5) Cooling (mold water channels 20-50°C circulating water, 10-60 seconds cycle time). (6) Mold opens, ejector pins push part out. **Plug designs:** NEMA 1-15P (USA 2-prong parallel blade, non-polarized or polarized one blade wider), NEMA 5-15P (USA 3-prong, two blades + round ground pin), NEMA 5-20P (15A, blades rotated 90°). IEC C13/C14 (international, 3-prong "computer cable" connector). BS 1363 (UK 3-prong rectangular, fused plug). Schuko CEE 7/4 (Europe 2-prong round + side ground clips). Australian AS 3112 (angled flat blades + ground). **Pin material:** Brass alloy (Cu-35%Zn, C26000 cartridge brass, high conductivity 28% IACS, machinability, corrosion resistance). Nickel plating: electroplate 3-10 µm Ni (barrier, prevents brass oxidation/tarnishing). Chrome or tin plating: 0.5-3 µm over nickel (contact surface, low resistance, wear resistance). **Pin manufacturing:** Bar stock (brass rod 3-8mm diameter), automatic screw machine (multi-spindle Swiss-type lathe) or progressive stamping press (flat brass strip → blank → form blade shape → bend prongs). Blade dimensions per standard (NEMA 1-15P: 6.35mm × 1.27mm × 15.9mm blades, 12.7mm spacing center-to-center). Tolerances ±0.1mm (ensure fit in wall receptacle, 2-8 N insertion force, 10-20 N retention force).

**Step 101-120: Cable-to-Plug Termination and Assembly**
**Preparation:** Strip jacket (30-50mm from cable end, rotary or thermal stripper, expose 3 insulated conductors). Strip each conductor insulation (8-12mm, expose stranded copper). Twist strands tight (prevent fraying), tin with solder (optional, flux-core solder 63/37 or SAC305, 300-350°C iron, 2-3 seconds, coat strand bundle). **Terminal connection methods:** (1) **Screw terminals:** Plug housing has brass screw terminals (M3 or M3.5 screw, 6-10mm length). Wrap tinned conductor around screw shank clockwise (when screw tightens, conductor pulls tighter, not out). Tighten screw: 0.5-1.2 N·m torque (Phillips or flathead screwdriver, 10-15 lb-in). Strain relief: clamp jacket with separate screw or molded barb inside plug housing (prevent conductor pullout, stress on terminals). (2) **Crimp terminals:** Crimp brass or copper terminal lug onto conductor (ring, spade, or fork terminal, crimping tool 50-200 N force). Bolt terminal lug to plug pin or brass bus bar inside housing. (3) **Solder lug:** Brass blade has solder cup (hole or cup at base), insert tinned conductor, solder (350-400°C iron, 5-10 seconds, flow solder around conductor and into cup, concave fillet). **Pin insertion:** Insert brass blade pins into plug housing from inside (press-fit, retention barbs or ribs on pin base snap into housing slots, 20-50 N insertion force, 100-200 N extraction force - designed permanent). Orient pins per standard (NEMA Line/Neutral/Ground positions, IEC pin numbering). **Cable grip/strain relief:** Internal clamp (plastic or metal jaws) or cord bushing compresses cable jacket (prevents pulling force from transferring to electrical connections, UL 817 pull test: 35 lb for 16 AWG, no movement >2mm at terminals).

**Step 121-142: Overmolding and Plug Completion**
**Insert molding (common method):** (1) Pre-assemble cable with pins inserted, conductors soldered/crimped, but plug housing open or partial. (2) Place assembly in injection mold (cable protrudes from one side, pins/terminals positioned by mold cavity). (3) Inject molten thermoplastic (PVC, TPE, or same resin as housing, 180-260°C, 50-150 MPa). (4) Plastic flows around cable-pin junctions, terminal connections, fills housing cavity. (5) Cool 10-60 seconds, solidifies, eject complete plug. **Advantages:** Waterproof seal (IP44-IP54 possible, molten plastic fuses to cable jacket, no gaps), strain relief integral (plastic grips jacket over 20-40mm length, distributes pulling force), faster assembly (no screws, snap-fits - molded in one step). **Disadvantages:** Not repairable (cannot open to replace cord or fix connection, disposal when damaged). **Two-piece housing (alternative):** Plug housing has top and bottom halves (injection molded separately). Assemble cable connections with screws/crimps, place in bottom housing half, snap or screw top housing onto bottom. Advantages: repairable, modular. Disadvantages: requires gasket for water resistance (rubber O-ring or ultrasonic welding to seal halves), slightly larger, costlier assembly. **Cord bushing:** Ribbed rubber grommet or PVC bushing at cable entry point (prevents sharp edge cutting into cable jacket during bending, flexes to 90° angle, reduces stress concentration). **Prong covers (safety):** Some plugs have insulated sleeves on blade prongs (1/2 to 2/3 of blade length covered, only tips exposed, prevents finger contact with live prongs when partially inserted in receptacle - common in Europe, UK, Australia, mandated by safety standards).

**Step 143-160: Electrical and Safety Testing - [UL/IEC Compliance](electrical-safety-tester)**
**Continuity test:** Automated tester applies low voltage (6-12V DC, <1A) to plug prongs, verifies connection to cable conductors and opposite end (if connector attached). Resistance: <0.1Ω for each conductor (line, neutral, ground), open circuit = fail (poor crimp, broken wire). Test all 3 conductors + shield (if shielded cable). **Polarity test:** Verify Line (hot) connects to correct prong (narrow blade in NEMA 5-15P, brown wire in IEC), Neutral to wide blade (white/blue wire), Ground to round pin (green/yellow). Reversed polarity = fail (safety hazard, device chassis could be hot). **Insulation resistance (IR):** Apply 500-1,000V DC between conductors (Line-Neutral, Line-Ground, Neutral-Ground), measure leakage current. IR must be >10 MΩ (UL 817), typically >100 MΩ for new cables (ensures no insulation defects, moisture ingress). **Dielectric withstand (hi-pot test):** Apply 1,250V AC (for 125V rated cable) or 2,500V AC (for 250V rated) for 1 minute between conductors and between conductors and water bath (submerge cable). No breakdown/arcing (proves insulation thickness, integrity - destructive potential, test 100% in production or sample). **Flexing test:** Clamp cable near plug, bend ±90° at strain relief point, 5,000-10,000 cycles (90-180 cycles/min, accelerated life test). Verify continuity maintained throughout (no intermittent opens due to conductor fatigue, jacket cracking). UL 817: 5,000 flexes for SJT jacket (thermoplastic service cord), 10,000 flexes for SJTW (weather-resistant). **Pull test:** Apply tensile force to cable (35 lb or 15.9 kg for 16 AWG per UL 817, 1 minute duration). Measure movement: conductor must not pull out >2mm at terminal, plug housing must not crack. If overmolded, jacket must not slip through strain relief. **Temperature rise:** Pass rated current (10A for 16 AWG) through cable for 4 hours, measure temperature at hottest point (typically plug pins/terminals). Rise must be <30°C above ambient (UL 817), <50°C total temperature (prevents insulation degradation, ensures safe operation at full load).

**Step 161-175: Certification Marks and Regulatory Compliance**
Power cords require certification in each country/region. **North America:** UL 817 (Cord Sets and Power-Supply Cords), CSA C22.2 No. 21 (Canada). Test laboratory (UL Solutions, Intertek ETL, TÜV Rheinland) evaluates design, production samples (electrical, mechanical, flammability tests), inspects factory. Upon approval, manufacturer may apply UL mark (UL in circle, file number E12345). Re-certification: design changes require re-test, quarterly factory inspections verify ongoing compliance. Cost: $5,000-15,000 initial certification (per cable type), $1,000-3,000/year surveillance. **Europe:** IEC 60227 (PVC insulated cables), EN 50525 (low voltage cables), CE mark (self-certification, manufacturer declares conformity). VDE testing institute (Germany) or BSI (UK) optional third-party certification (VDE mark, BS mark, higher credibility). **China:** CCC mark (China Compulsory Certification) required for imports/sales. GB 5023 standard (similar to IEC 60227). Test at CNAS-accredited lab, factory audit, annual surveillance. Cost: $3,000-8,000, 3-6 months process. **Japan:** PSE mark (Product Safety Electrical Appliance), JIS C 3306 standard. Test at JET or approved lab, register with METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry). **Australia:** RCM mark (Regulatory Compliance Mark), AS/NZS 3191 standard. Test at SAI Global or Nemko. **UK (post-Brexit):** UKCA mark required (replacing CE for GB market, similar requirements to CE but separate certification). **Cord designation codes:** UL/CSA use letter codes: (1) S = Service cord (600V, general use, 60-90°C). (2) J = Junior service (300V, lighter duty). (3) T = Thermoplastic (PVC jacket). (4) O = Oil-resistant. (5) W = Weather/water-resistant. Examples: SJT (300V thermoplastic service), SJTW (SJT + weather), SVT (300V vacuum/appliance), SPT-2 (lamp cord, parallel 18 AWG). European: H05VV-F (300V PVC insulated flexible), H07RN-F (450V rubber insulated flexible).

**Step 176-185: Packaging, Labeling, and Distribution**
**Packaging:** (1) Cable tie or twist-tie coils cable (1-3 meter length typical for consumer cables, coil diameter 10-20 cm). (2) Polybag (LDPE or PP, 50-100 µm thickness, antistatic treated if needed, resealable zipper or heat-seal). (3) Label: adhesive sticker or cardboard sleeve, specifications (voltage rating 125V or 250V, current 10A/13A/15A, AWG gauge, cord type SJT/SVT, length 1m/1.8m/3m, plug type NEMA 5-15P / IEC C13 / Schuko, certification marks UL/CSA/VDE/CCC/PSE). Barcode (UPC or EAN-13, SKU for inventory). (4) Blister pack (alternative): thermoformed PET or PVC clamshell, cardboard backer, heat-sealed (retail hanging display, prevents theft). **Bulk packaging:** Cartons (corrugated cardboard, 100-500 cables per box, 10-20 kg total weight). Master carton label: product code, quantity, gross/net weight, country of origin "Made in China" (COO declaration for customs). Pallet load: 40-80 cartons, stretch wrap, corner protectors. **Quality documentation:** Certificate of compliance (CoC), test reports (hi-pot, IR, continuity summary), material declarations (RoHS compliance, no lead Pb, mercury Hg, cadmium Cd, hexavalent chromium Cr⁶⁺, PBB/PBDE flame retardants per EU RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU). REACH SVHC (substances of very high concern) declaration: no phthalates beyond threshold (DINP allowed, DEHP restricted). **Distribution:** Container shipping (20' or 40' HC container, 1,500-3,000 cartons per 40' HC, 10-15 tonnes). Export from China/Vietnam to USA (15-25 days ocean freight, Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach), to Europe (Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, 20-35 days). Import duties: USA HTS code 8544.42.20 (cordage, 2.6-3.1% duty), Europe HS 854442 (2.7% duty). Warehousing: distributor DC (distribution center, pick and pack for retail orders, Amazon FBA fulfillment centers, B&H Photo, Newegg, Grainger industrial supply).

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Manufacturing Economics**
Global power cord production: 2-3 billion cords/year (replacement cables, OEM bundled with devices, aftermarket). Segments: (1) OEM bundled (50-60%, laptops, monitors, printers - low-cost NEMA 1-15P or IEC C5/C7, $0.50-1.50 per unit OEM price). (2) Aftermarket replacement (30-40%, higher quality, retail packaging, $3-10 consumer retail). (3) Industrial/commercial (5-10%, heavy-duty SOOW/SJOOW cables 12-14 AWG, hospital-grade, UL 817 + UL 60601 medical compliance, $10-30 per cord). **Pricing examples:** Basic 6-foot NEMA 5-15P to IEC C13 (18 AWG 3-conductor, PVC jacket, UL listed): $2-4 wholesale, $5-8 retail. Premium 10-foot (16 AWG, SJTW jacket, heavy-duty, locking connector): $8-15 wholesale, $15-25 retail. International travel adapter cable set (NEMA to Schuko/UK/AU, 3-pack): $12-20 retail. **Manufacturing cost (example 6-foot 18 AWG SJT NEMA 5-15P):** Copper wire $0.80 (3×1.5 meters × 18 AWG 0.75 mm², 3.4 grams Cu per meter × 4.5 meters total = 15g Cu, $6/kg copper + stranding), PVC insulation $0.30 (compounds, extrusion energy), PVC jacket $0.40, Plug molding + pins $0.60 (brass, resin, injection molding cycle), Assembly labor $0.30 (0.5-1.0 minutes per cord, China labor $3-5/hour), Testing $0.10 (automated, amortized equipment cost), Packaging $0.15 (polybag, label, carton allocation), Overhead/scrap $0.25. **Total cost $2.90-3.20.** Wholesale price $4-5 (38-55% margin). Retail $8-10 (100% markup). **Production locations:** China (70-75%, Volex Dongguan, Ningbo Chenglong, Shenzhen Deren, 10-100 million cords/year capacity per large factory). Vietnam (10-15%, Sino-American Cable, labor cost advantage over China $2.50-3.50/hour vs $4-6/hour in China coastal). Mexico (5-8%, near-shoring for USA market, Volex Reynosa, tariff-free under USMCA, labor $3-5/hour). India (3-5%, domestic + export). USA/Europe (<2%, highly automated, specialty/low-volume). **Automation:** Modern factories 80-90% automated (extrusion, cutting, stripping, crimping, insert molding - unmanned lines 1,000-5,000 cords/shift). Labor mainly quality inspection, machine setup, packaging. **Profit margins:** Manufacturers 10-25% (commodity cables thin margin, OEM contracts 5-15%, aftermarket branded 20-35%). Retailers 30-50% (electronics stores, online).
