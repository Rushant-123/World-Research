## Manufacturing Labor Summary

Manufacturing labor represents the human capital essential for electronics production, requiring systematic development from recruitment through retention. The workforce requires extensive training spanning foundational skills (80 hours), IPC certification (80 hours), quality systems, and lean manufacturing principles. Performance management systems track productivity (units/hour), quality yield (target >98%), attendance (>95%), and safety (TRIR <1.0). Cross-training programs develop workforce flexibility, while career progression and competitive compensation (typical range $2-5/hour base wage in Asia, $15-25/hour in developed markets) support retention. Compliance with labor regulations, certification maintenance (IPC recertification every 2 years), and continuous improvement participation (2+ suggestions/employee/year) ensure sustainable manufacturing capability. Effective workforce management achieves typical productivity targets of 85%+ efficiency, turnover rates below 20% annually, and quality yields exceeding 98% through systematic training, engagement, and development programs.
