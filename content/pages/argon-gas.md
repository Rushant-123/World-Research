# How to Make Argon Gas

Noble gas (doesn't react). Atmosphere: 0.93% Ar. Produced as byproduct of oxygen/nitrogen production via [Cryogenic Distillation](air-separation-plant) of [Air](atmospheric-air). Argon boiling point: -186°C (between N₂ and O₂). Collected from middle fraction. [Purification](getter-purification) removes traces of N₂ and O₂. Purity: 99.999%.

**Uses:** Inert atmosphere for welding, semiconductor processing, crystal growing, light bulb fill gas. Price: $0.50-2/kg depending on purity. Semiconductor-grade (99.9999%): $5-10/kg.
