# How to Make Argon Gas (Ar)

Noble gas - chemically inert, third most abundant in atmosphere (0.93%). Production: 1.5 million tonnes/year globally (2023). Uses: welding shielding gas (TIG, MIG, 40% of consumption), steel manufacturing (argon-oxygen decarburization AOD, 25%), semiconductor processing (sputtering, ion implantation, CVD, 15%), lighting (incandescent, fluorescent fill gas, 8%), metal production (titanium, silicon crystals, 7%), analytical instruments (ICP-MS, carrier gas, 3%), other 2%. Exclusively produced as byproduct of cryogenic air separation (oxygen/nitrogen production) - argon concentrates in middle section of distillation column due to intermediate boiling point (-186°C, between nitrogen -196°C and oxygen -183°C). Economic production only viable at large oxygen plants (>1,000 tonnes O₂/day), smaller plants vent argon with waste nitrogen (uneconomical to recover <500 kg/day Ar).

**Step 1-15: Source and Atmospheric Concentration**
[Atmospheric air](atmospheric-air) composition: Ar 0.934% (9,340 ppm by volume), third most abundant after N₂ (78.08%) and O₂ (20.95%). Primordial argon-40 (⁴⁰Ar) from radioactive decay of potassium-40 (⁴⁰K) in Earth's crust over 4.5 billion years (half-life 1.25 billion years), accumulated in atmosphere. Stable isotope: ⁴⁰Ar (99.6%), ³⁶Ar (0.34%), ³⁸Ar (0.06%). Inert: full valence electron shell (3s²3p⁶ configuration), no chemical bonds, monatomic gas. Properties: molecular weight 39.95 g/mol (heavier than air 28.97, but mixes uniformly due to atmospheric mixing, diffusion over geological time). Argon in air: 1.293 kg/m³ air × 0.00934 = 0.0121 kg Ar/m³ air (12 g/m³). For 1 kg Ar: need 83 m³ air. Global production 1.5 Mt/year requires processing 125 billion m³ air/year (only 0.04% of total air separation capacity, argon recovered from ~10% of O₂/N₂ plants that have argon recovery units, rest vents argon as waste).

**Step 16-32: [Cryogenic Air Separation](air-separation-unit) - Crude Argon Extraction**
Argon extracted from low-pressure column of double-column air separation unit (ASU). **Process integration**: Main nitrogen/oxygen ASU operates per standard Linde-Frankl cycle (see nitrogen-gas page for details: air compression 5-7 bar, molecular sieve purification, plate-fin cooling to -190°C, two-column distillation). **Argon concentration zone**: In low-pressure column (1.2-1.5 bar), argon accumulates at specific trays (typically tray 5-15 from bottom of 50-90 tray column). Reason: Argon boiling point -186°C intermediate between N₂ (-196°C) and O₂ (-183°C), plus relative volatility vs oxygen α(Ar/O₂) = 1.2-1.4 (moderate, requires many theoretical stages for separation). Liquid flowing down column enriches in oxygen + argon, vapor rising enriches in nitrogen. At equilibrium tray position (10-40% column height), liquid composition reaches 10-15% Ar, 80-88% O₂, 2-5% N₂ (crude argon, maximum practical concentration in main column without dedicated argon section). **Side-draw**: Withdraw vapor or liquid from this concentration zone (draw rate 1-3% of main column throughput), feed to auxiliary argon column. Draw location optimized: too high (more nitrogen contamination), too low (more oxygen, less argon). Flow rate: For 3,000 tonne/day O₂ plant (producing ~7,500 tonne/day N₂), crude argon draw ~30-60 tonne/day (12-15% Ar by weight in mixture), yields 4-9 tonne/day pure Ar product (0.5-1.0% of air processed as argon).

**Step 33-55: [Argon Column](cryogenic-distillation) - High-Purity Distillation**
Dedicated **crude argon column**: Vertical distillation column (1-2.5m diameter, 10-30m tall, 40-100 trays or structured packing), operates 1.2-1.5 bar, -186 to -190°C. Feed: crude argon from main column (12% Ar, 85% O₂, 3% N₂). Objective: separate argon from oxygen and nitrogen to >99.5% purity. **Bottom section** (stripping section, 20-50 trays): Vapor rises, liquid descends. Oxygen (less volatile, heavier) stripped from argon, concentrates in bottom liquid, returned to main oxygen column (recycle, no oxygen loss). **Top section** (rectification section, 20-50 trays): Nitrogen (more volatile) separated from argon, exits top as nitrogen-rich vapor, returned to main nitrogen column. **Reboiler**: Bottom liquid (oxygen-enriched) heated by condensing oxygen vapor from main column or electric heaters (1-2 MW), generates vapor for upward flow. Boilup ratio: 3-8 (kg vapor/kg feed). **Condenser**: Top vapor (nitrogen + trace argon) partially condensed by evaporating liquid argon product (thermosiphon reboiler-condenser integration, similar to main column coupling), or auxiliary refrigeration. Reflux ratio: 2-5 (kg liquid returned/kg product). **Product draw**: Argon-rich liquid (98-99.9% Ar, 0.5-1.5% O₂, 0.1-0.5% N₂) withdrawn from tray 5-10 below top (maximum purity zone, balance between nitrogen contamination from above and oxygen from below). Liquid argon: -186°C, 1.4 g/mL density. Yield: 92-96% of argon in crude feed recovered as high-purity product (losses 4-8% to top nitrogen and bottom oxygen streams). **Energy**: Argon column energy-intensive (additional refrigeration, reboiler duty 0.5-1.5 kWh/kg Ar), increases overall ASU power consumption 5-10% when argon recovery installed (tradeoff: argon value $0.50-2.00/kg offsets energy cost $0.05-0.15/kg).

**Step 56-75: Oxygen Removal - [Deoxo Catalytic Purification](oxygen-removal-catalyst)**
Argon from distillation: 98.5-99.5% Ar, 0.5-1.5% O₂, <0.5% N₂. Oxygen removal critical for welding (O₂ causes weld oxidation, porosity, embrittlement) and semiconductor applications (reacts with silicon, metals). **Catalytic deoxo unit**: Add hydrogen gas (0.5-3% H₂, slight stoichiometric excess, 2H₂ per O₂), pass through [palladium catalyst](oxygen-removal-catalyst) (Pd on alumina support, 0.5-1% Pd loading, pellets 3-5mm, packed bed reactor). Operating conditions: 200-400°C (low-temperature Pd catalysts active at 150°C, high-temperature 300-400°C), 3-10 bar pressure. Reaction: O₂ + 2H₂ → 2H₂O (exothermic, ΔH = -484 kJ/mol, 99.9+% conversion). Product: argon + water vapor + trace unreacted H₂ (<100 ppm). **Water removal**: Cool gas to 10-20°C in heat exchanger (condenses bulk water, separates in knockout drum). Further dry: molecular sieve adsorption (zeolite 3A, 4A, or 5A, two-vessel PSA, regenerate with hot dry argon, cycle 4-8 hours). Final dewpoint: <-70°C (moisture <1 ppm by volume). **Hydrogen removal**: Residual H₂ (100-1,000 ppm) removed by: (1) Additional oxygen dosing + second catalyst bed (reverse of deoxo, combust H₂, trace O₂ addition carefully controlled, 0.05-0.1% O₂ + H₂ → H₂O, then dry again). (2) Membrane separation (Pd-Ag membrane, H₂ permeates selectively, expensive, rare). (3) Accept low ppm H₂ (welding grades tolerate <10 ppm H₂, semiconductor requires <0.1 ppm, use getter for UHP). Purity after deoxo: 99.95-99.99% Ar, <5 ppm O₂, <10 ppm H₂, <1 ppm H₂O, <5,000 ppm N₂.

**Step 76-92: [Getter Purification](titanium-getter) - Ultra-High Purity (UHP)**
Semiconductor/specialty applications require 99.999-99.9999% Ar (<1 ppm total impurities). **Getter principle**: Chemically reactive metal (titanium, zirconium, calcium, barium) at high temperature (500-900°C) reacts irreversibly with impurities (O₂, N₂, H₂, H₂O, CO, CO₂, hydrocarbons), forms solid compounds (oxides, nitrides, hydrides, carbides), leaves ultra-pure argon. **[Titanium getter](titanium-getter)**: Most common for argon. Packed bed reactor: titanium metal (sponge, turnings, or deposited on substrate, high surface area), heated to 500-700°C (induction heating or resistance furnace), argon flows through. Reactions: Ti + O₂ → TiO₂ (titanium dioxide, irreversible), 2Ti + N₂ → 2TiN (titanium nitride, slower kinetics, high temperature enhances), Ti + 2H₂ → TiH₂ (titanium hydride, reversible but stable <700°C), Ti + H₂O → TiO + H₂ (oxidation). Capacity: 1-5 wt% impurity uptake before saturation (100 kg Ti getter purifies 1,000-5,000 kg Ar depending on initial purity), then replace or regenerate (heat to 900°C under vacuum, decomposes hydrides, evaporates some impurities, partial regeneration). **Alternative getters**: Zirconium (similar to Ti, higher cost, better for N₂ removal), BaLi₄ alloy (500°C, excellent for all impurities, pyrophoric, safety concerns), hot copper (300-400°C, removes O₂ only, forms Cu₂O). **Result**: UHP argon 99.9999% (5N or 6N), <0.1 ppm O₂, <0.5 ppm N₂, <0.1 ppm H₂O, <0.1 ppm THC (total hydrocarbons), <0.1 ppm CO/CO₂. Semiconductor-grade specification: meets SEMI C3.10 standard. **Cost**: Getter purification adds $0.20-0.50/kg to production cost (capex for reactors, energy 0.3-0.5 kWh/kg, getter material replacement $0.05-0.10/kg amortized).

**Step 93-108: Compression and Liquefaction**
**Gaseous argon compression**: From purification (near-atmospheric pressure 1.2-2 bar, 20-40°C) to delivery pressure 150-300 bar (high-pressure cylinders, tube trailers). Multi-stage compressor: 3-5 stages reciprocating or centrifugal, intercooling to 30-40°C between stages (water-cooled or air-cooled heat exchangers). Interstage pressure ratios: 2.5-4× per stage (1.5 bar → 5 bar → 20 bar → 80 bar → 300 bar). Compressor materials: carbon steel or stainless (argon non-corrosive, inert). Lubrication: Oil-free compressors for high-purity grades (oil contamination <0.1 ppm), or filtered/coalesced to remove oil aerosols. Power: 0.15-0.30 kWh/Nm³ for 200 bar compression. **Liquid argon production**: Collect liquid directly from argon column (-186°C, 1.4 bar, 1.4 g/mL), or reliquefy gaseous argon in cryogenic liquefier. Liquefaction: Cool gas to -186°C using cascade refrigeration (liquid nitrogen pre-cool to -196°C, then Joule-Thomson expansion or turbo-expander final cooling). Energy: 0.8-1.5 kWh/kg liquid Ar (includes compression to 10-20 bar, refrigeration). Boiling point: -186°C @ 1 bar, -173°C @ 5 bar, -158°C @ 20 bar. Liquid density: 1.40 kg/L @ -186°C. **Liquid storage**: Cryogenic tanks (vacuum-insulated, stainless steel inner vessel, carbon steel outer, perlite or multilayer insulation). Bulk tanks: 5,000-50,000L on-site at customer or ASU plant, 1.5-3 bar operating pressure, boiloff rate 0.2-1% per day (heat leak, vented or reliquefied). ISO tankers: 20,000-24,000L for road transport, rail cars 30,000-50,000L. Argon less volatile than nitrogen (higher boiling point, lower heat of vaporization 161 kJ/kg vs 199 kJ/kg for N₂), easier to store (lower boiloff).

**Step 109-125: Argon Applications - Welding and Metal Fabrication**
**Largest use** (40% consumption): Shielding gas for arc welding. **TIG welding** (Tungsten Inert Gas, GTAW Gas Tungsten Arc Welding): Non-consumable tungsten electrode, argon shrouds weld pool, prevents oxidation. Pure argon (99.995-99.999%) for aluminum, magnesium, titanium, stainless steel (reactive metals). Argon ionizes easily (low ionization energy 15.76 eV), stable arc, good heat transfer. Flow rate: 10-20 liters/min (0.6-1.2 m³/h). **MIG welding** (Metal Inert Gas, GMAW Gas Metal Arc Welding): Consumable wire electrode, argon or argon mixtures (Ar + 1-5% O₂ for steel, Ar + 25% CO₂ for carbon steel, reduces spatter, improves penetration). Flow rate: 15-25 L/min. **Plasma cutting**: Argon + H₂ mixture (Ar-H₂ 65:35), high-temperature plasma arc (15,000-30,000°C), cuts stainless steel, aluminum. Argon advantage over nitrogen: Inert (no nitride formation in titanium, stainless), no hydrogen embrittlement (vs pure H₂), cleaner welds. Consumption: 1-3 kg argon per kg weld metal (TIG aluminum, high flow rates, long weld times), 0.1-0.5 kg (MIG steel, faster, argon mixtures). Welding-grade argon: 99.995% (industrial welding), 99.999% (aerospace, nuclear), <10 ppm O₂, <10 ppm N₂, <5 ppm H₂O, <5 ppm THC. Supply: High-pressure cylinders (200 bar, 8-10 m³), bundles, bulk liquid tanks + vaporizers (high-volume fabrication shops 100-1,000 m³/day).

**Step 126-142: Applications - Steel Manufacturing (AOD Process)**
**Argon-oxygen decarburization (AOD)**: Refining stainless steel. Molten steel from electric arc furnace (1,600-1,700°C, high carbon 2-4%) requires decarburization (reduce carbon to <0.03% for 304/316 stainless) without excessive chromium oxidation (Cr valuable alloying element, 18-20% in stainless, oxidizes to Cr₂O₃ at high oxygen, lost to slag). **AOD converter**: Refractory-lined vessel (20-150 tonnes capacity), tiltable, tuyeres (nozzles) inject gas into molten steel. **Process stages**: (1) Decarburization: Inject oxygen + argon mixture (Ar:O₂ = 1:1 to 1:3), carbon reacts C + O → CO (carbon monoxide gas, bubbles out, stirs bath). Temperature maintained 1,600-1,700°C (exothermic oxidation, some cooling with scrap or lime). Duration: 20-60 minutes, carbon 2% → 0.5%. (2) Reduction stage: Increase argon ratio (Ar:O₂ = 5:1 to 10:1, mostly argon), lower oxygen partial pressure, thermodynamics favor chromium retention, carbon continues removal (equilibrium shift). Final carbon <0.03%. (3) Finish: Pure argon purge (5-10 minutes, homogenize composition, remove dissolved gases N₂, H₂, prevent porosity). **Argon role**: Dilutes oxygen (controls reaction rate, prevents over-oxidation), provides stirring (gas injection turbulence, improves kinetics, homogenizes temperature/composition), reduces chromium loss (low O₂ partial pressure). Consumption: 2-5 Nm³ Ar per tonne stainless steel (10-25 kg, cost $8-20/tonne steel @ $0.80/kg Ar). Alternative: Nitrogen cheaper ($0.15/kg) but forms chromium nitride (increases nitrogen content, undesirable in some grades), argon preferred for low-nitrogen stainless (<0.03% N₂). Global stainless production: 55 Mt/year → 110,000-275,000 tonnes Ar consumption (7-18% of global Ar production, major driver of demand).

**Step 143-160: Applications - Semiconductor Manufacturing**
**High-purity argon** (99.9999%) used throughout semiconductor fab. **(1) Sputtering**: Physical vapor deposition (PVD) of metal films (aluminum, copper, titanium, tantalum interconnects and barriers). Process: Argon ions (Ar⁺) accelerated in electric field (1-10 kV), bombard metal target, eject atoms, deposit on silicon wafer. Vacuum chamber 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻³ mbar, argon flow 10-100 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute, 0.6-6 L/h). Argon ideal: Heavy atom (mass 40 vs 28 N₂, 32 O₂), high momentum transfer (efficient sputtering), inert (no compound formation, pure metal films). Consumption: 0.1-1 L argon per 300mm wafer (depends on film thickness, sputter rate). **(2) Ion implantation**: Argon ions implanted for amorphization (pre-amorphize silicon before boron implant, reduce channeling), or isolation (SIMOX Silicon-on-Insulator by oxygen implant uses argon co-implant). Dose: 10¹⁴-10¹⁶ ions/cm², energy 10-200 keV. **(3) CVD plasma**: Argon carrier gas or plasma ignition gas (CVD chambers use Ar to strike RF plasma, then switch to reactive gases). **(4) Purge/inerting**: Chamber cleaning cycles, loadlock purge (prevent atmospheric contamination), FOUP (Front Opening Unified Pod) wafer storage (<1 ppm O₂, Ar or N₂). **Fab consumption**: 1,000-10,000 Nm³/day (large 300mm fab, 50,000 wafer starts/month), lower than nitrogen (10,000-100,000 Nm³/day N₂) but higher purity required. Supply: Bulk liquid Ar tank (20,000-50,000L, -186°C), vaporizer, gas cabinet with regulators/purifiers, point-of-use filtration (0.003 µm particle filters, gas purifier panels <0.1 ppb O₂/H₂O). Cost: $2-8/kg UHP argon delivered to fab (vs $2-5/kg UHP nitrogen, argon 1.5-2× premium).

**Step 161-172: Applications - Lighting and Analytical**
**Lighting**: Argon fill gas for incandescent, fluorescent, discharge lamps. Incandescent bulbs: Argon (or Ar/N₂ 90:10) at 0.8-1.0 bar, fills bulb, reduces tungsten filament evaporation (evaporation in vacuum rapid at 2,500-3,000°C, argon pressure suppresses via collision, extends life 2-5×). Argon preferred over air (O₂ oxidizes tungsten W + O₂ → WO₃), nitrogen (N₂ reacts at high temp W + N₂ → WN), or vacuum (high evaporation). Consumption: 0.01-0.1 grams Ar per bulb (negligible, but 10 billion bulbs/year → 100-1,000 tonnes Ar). Fluorescent tubes: Argon 3 mbar + mercury vapor, UV discharge excites phosphor coating. **Argon-ion lasers**: Ar⁺ laser (488 nm blue, 514 nm green), scientific/medical applications, phased out by solid-state lasers (argon laser inefficient 0.1%, but tunable). **Analytical instruments**: ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry), ICP-OES (Optical Emission Spectroscopy). Argon plasma (6,000-10,000 K) ionizes sample, trace element analysis (ppb-ppt detection). Flow rate: 10-20 L/min (0.6-1.2 m³/h, 10-17 kg/day). High-purity 99.9999% required (contamination interferes with measurements). GC (Gas Chromatography) carrier gas: Argon for electron capture detector (ECD), alternative to helium or nitrogen. **Medical**: Argon plasma coagulation (APC, endoscopic surgery, argon plasma beam coagulates tissue). Cryosurgery: Argon gas expansion cooling (Joule-Thomson effect, -140°C at probe tip, freezes tumors, ablation). Consumption: Small volume high-value (medical-grade $5-20/kg, validated supply chain, traceability).

**Step 173-185: Safety, Handling, and Environmental**
**Asphyxiation hazard**: Argon heavier than air (density 1.78 kg/m³ vs 1.29 air), accumulates in low-lying areas (pits, basements, trenches, confined spaces), displaces oxygen, odorless/colorless (no warning). Symptoms: Dizziness, unconsciousness in 1-2 breaths (<6% O₂), death in minutes. Incidents: Tank leaks in enclosed spaces, confined space entry without monitoring, nitrogen/argon tank confusion (identical appearance, wrong gas label). Precautions: Oxygen monitors (continuous, alarm <19.5% O₂), ventilation (ground-level exhaust in low areas), SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) for confined space, buddy system, lockout/tagout on tanks. **Cryogenic hazards**: Liquid argon -186°C, frostbite on skin contact (seconds), eye damage (blindness if splashed), embrittlement of materials (carbon steel brittle <-40°C, use stainless steel for cryogenic service). Pressure: Liquid-to-gas expansion 1:841 (1 L liquid → 841 L gas @ 15°C), rapid vaporization in sealed container → overpressure, rupture (tanks require relief valves, burst discs, rated 1.5-3 bar). **Transport**: DOT/UN classification: Compressed gas (UN1006, argon gas), Refrigerated liquid (UN1951, argon liquid). Cylinders: 200-300 bar, 40-50L water volume, 8-10 m³ gas, CGA-580 valve (brass, nickel-plated). Color code: Gray or green cylinder (varies by country, US no standardized color, rely on label). Tube trailers: 200-300 bar, 3,000-5,000 m³. Liquid ISO tanks: 20,000-24,000L, vacuum-insulated, <1% boiloff/day. **Environmental**: Zero global warming potential (GWP = 0), zero ozone depletion (ODP = 0), non-toxic, non-flammable, non-reactive. Emissions: Released argon returns to atmosphere (naturally occurring, no accumulation, no impact). Energy/carbon footprint: From electricity for air separation (0.5-0.8 kWh/kg Ar, 0.3-0.6 kg CO₂e/kg Ar @ grid mix), renewable ASU reduces footprint to near-zero.

**Step 186-195: Market, Economics, and Pricing**
**Global production**: 1.5 million tonnes/year (2023), co-product of oxygen/nitrogen (argon recovery installed at ~8-12% of ASUs worldwide, primarily large O₂ plants >1,000 tonne/day, smaller plants uneconomical). Regional: China 30% (450 kt), USA 20% (300 kt), Europe 18% (270 kt), India 8% (120 kt), Japan 6% (90 kt), Middle East 5% (75 kt), other 13% (195 kt). Growth: 3-4% per year (driven by stainless steel production in Asia, semiconductor expansion, welding automation). **Merchant vs captive**: 80% merchant (sold to external customers, welding distributors, industrial gas companies), 20% captive (integrated steel mills, semiconductor fabs with on-site ASU). **Pricing**: Wide range by purity and delivery. (1) Welding-grade gaseous (99.995%), cylinder: $2-6/m³ ($1.00-3.00/kg, depends on volume, location, contract vs spot). (2) Bulk liquid (99.998%), tanker delivery: $0.50-1.50/kg ($0.35-1.00/L, lower for high-volume contract >50 tonne/month). (3) UHP semiconductor-grade (99.9999%), cylinder or bulk with purifiers: $3-10/kg. (4) On-site generation (rare, only largest users): $0.40-0.80/kg amortized (requires >100 tonne/day, dedicated ASU with argon recovery, capex $50-150M, 8-15 year payback). **Cost structure**: Argon as byproduct, cost allocation complex. (1) Energy: 0.5-0.8 kWh/kg (argon column, purification, compression), $25-60/tonne @ $50-70/MWh electricity. (2) Capital: Argon recovery adds $30-80/tonne/day capacity to ASU (argon column, deoxo, getters, liquefaction), 1,000 kg/day Ar module = $30-80M capex. (3) Operating: Catalyst replacement ($0.05-0.10/kg), molecular sieve ($0.02-0.05/kg), maintenance, labor. (4) Feedstock: Air free, but opportunity cost (argon recovery diverts some O₂/N₂ production, reduces main column efficiency 1-3%, tradeoff in plant design). Total production cost: $0.30-0.70/kg (large integrated ASU), $0.50-1.20/kg (small standalone or purified grades). **Economics**: Profitability depends on oxygen/nitrogen market (argon byproduct, if O₂ demand strong → ASU runs → argon produced, if weak → ASU curtails → argon supply tight). Price volatility: 2010-2024 range $0.40-2.50/kg (bulk liquid), spike in 2021-2022 (semiconductor boom, stainless steel demand, energy crisis reduced ASU operations), stabilized 2023-2024 to $0.60-1.20/kg. Future: Semiconductor expansion (2024-2030, $500B fab investments, Taiwan, Arizona, Germany, Japan) increases UHP argon demand 20-30%, tightens supply, supports premium pricing $2-5/kg for UHP vs $0.60-1.20/kg bulk.

Price: $0.80/kg represents bulk liquid argon (99.998% purity, tanker delivery, industrial-grade for welding/steel). Welding-grade cylinder $1.50-3.00/kg, UHP semiconductor $3-10/kg. Stainless steel producer (high-volume contract) $0.50-0.80/kg. Per-chip allocation: Semiconductor fab uses 1-10 L Ar per wafer (sputtering, ion implant), 0.001-0.01 kg/wafer, cost $0.003-0.10/wafer @ $3-10/kg UHP. Wafer yields 500-2,000 chips (logic dies) → $0.00001-0.0002/chip argon cost (negligible, fraction of mill, absorbed into processing overhead).
