# How to Make Transmission Lines

**Market Leader:** [Utilities](/companies/utilities)



High-voltage power lines carrying electricity long distances. [Aluminum Conductor](aluminum-conductor) cables (ACSR - Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced) suspended from [Steel Towers](steel-towers) by [Ceramic Insulators](ceramic-insulators). Voltages: 115kV to 765kV. Higher voltage = less current for same power = lower resistive losses.

**Construction:** Survey route, acquire right-of-way, erect towers every 200-500m, string conductors, energize line. [Installation](line-construction) requires helicopters for remote areas, specialized equipment. 3-phase AC system uses 3 conductors + optional ground wire.

**Specifications:** ACSR cable diameter: 25-50mm, weight: 2-5 kg/m. Sag: 10-20m between towers. Clearance: 6-15m above ground. Capacity: 500-2000 MW per line. Losses: 2-4% per 100km.
