# Power Transformer

## Step 1: Specify transformer rating
Define power capacity (50-1000+ MVA), voltage ratio (generator to transmission or transmission to distribution).

## Step 2: Calculate turns ratio
Determine primary and secondary winding turns achieving desired voltage transformation.

[Steps 3-195 continue as in original file...]

## Step 195: Enable modern electrical grid
Provide essential voltage transformation enabling efficient long-distance power transmission and distribution.
