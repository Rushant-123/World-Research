# How to Make Testing Equipment

**Top Market Leaders:**

- [Advantest](/companies/advantest)
- [Keysight](/companies/keysight)



Automated test equipment (ATE) for semiconductors, boards, and assemblies. Tests electrical parameters, functionality, performance. Chip testing costs $0.01-1 per chip (5-30% of manufacturing cost for complex chips).

**Wafer Test:** [Probe Cards](wafer-probe-card) with hundreds of needles contact wafer pads. Test each die. Sort into bins by performance. **Final Test:** After packaging, [Test Handlers](test-handlers) move chips through test sockets. [Test Instruments](electronic-test-gear) apply signals, measure responses. [Test Software](test-software) defines patterns and pass/fail criteria. [Calibration](standards-calibration) against NIST standards ensures accuracy.

ATE systems: $2-10 million. Test speeds: 100-1000 chips/hour. Parallel testing (8-32 chips simultaneously) increases throughput.
