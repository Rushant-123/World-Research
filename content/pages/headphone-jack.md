A 3.5mm TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) audio connector socket that accepts standard headphone plugs. Provides analog audio output (left/right channels) and microphone input. Spring-loaded contacts ensure reliable connection. Also called TRS jack, audio jack, or phone jack (derived from 1/4" phone connectors used in telephone switchboards).

## What is it?

A cylindrical socket connector with 4 internal spring contacts arranged concentrically. Accepts 3.5mm (1/8 inch) diameter plug with 4 conductive sections separated by insulating rings. Contact configuration: Tip (left audio), Ring 1 (right audio), Ring 2 (microphone/ground), Sleeve (ground). Spring contacts provide 100-200 grams insertion force. Switching contacts detect plug insertion. Housing: thermoplastic (LCP, PBT) injection molded. Mounting: PCB through-hole or SMT. Durability: 5,000-10,000 mating cycles.
