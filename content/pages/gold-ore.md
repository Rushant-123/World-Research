1. Conduct geological exploration identifying gold-bearing ore bodies using drilling and assays

2. Analyze drill core samples measuring gold content in grams per tonne (g/t)

3. Delineate ore reserves with economic gold grades (>0.5 g/t for open pit, >3 g/t underground)

4. Remove overburden using hydraulic excavators and haul trucks

5. Drill blast holes in ore body using rotary blast hole drills (150-300mm diameter)

6. Load blast holes with ANFO explosives and electronic detonators

7. Execute controlled blast fragmenting ore to manageable size (<800mm)

8. Load blasted ore into 200-400 ton haul trucks using electric rope shovels

9. Transport ore to run-of-mine (ROM) stockpile or directly to crusher

10. Sample ore loads using automatic samplers analyzing gold grade

11. Segregate ore by grade into separate stockpiles (high-grade, mill-grade, low-grade)

12. Crush ore in primary gyratory crusher reducing size to <200mm

13. Convey crushed ore to grinding mills via overland conveyor system

14. Grind ore in SAG mill and ball mill achieving 80% passing 75 microns

15. Add water creating slurry pumped to leaching or gravity recovery circuits

16. Recover coarse gold using gravity concentrators (Knelson, Falcon) ahead of leaching

17. Condition ore slurry with lime raising pH to 10.5-11 for cyanide leaching

18. Add sodium cyanide solution (NaCN) at 200-500 g/tonne forming soluble gold complex

19. Agitate slurry in leach tanks for 12-48 hours dissolving gold: Au + 2CN⁻ + O₂ → Au(CN)₂⁻

20. Achieve gold dissolution of 85-98% depending on ore mineralogy

21. Pump pregnant leach solution through carbon-in-pulp (CIP) or carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuit

22. Adsorb dissolved gold onto activated carbon granules in agitated tanks

23. Transfer loaded carbon to elution circuit stripping gold using hot caustic solution

24. Recover gold from solution by electrowinning onto steel wool cathodes

25. Smelt gold sludge in electric furnace at 1200°C forming doré bullion

26. Cast molten gold into bars (20-30 kg) containing 80-95% gold, 5-15% silver

27. Assay doré bars using fire assay and ICP-MS determining gold and silver content

28. Ship doré bars to refinery for electrolytic refining to 99.99% fine gold

29. Process tailings through cyanide destruction circuit (SO₂, hydrogen peroxide, or Caro's acid)

30. Pump detoxified tailings to tailings storage facility (TSF) for settling

31. Reclaim water from TSF recycling 80-95% of process water reducing fresh water consumption

32. Monitor groundwater wells surrounding TSF ensuring no cyanide or metals leakage

33. Conduct environmental monitoring measuring air quality, water quality, and wildlife impacts

34. Perform progressive reclamation contouring and vegetating mined-out areas

35. Gold ore produces refined gold bullion used in jewelry (50%), investment bars and coins (30%), electronics (10%), dentistry (3%), and other industrial applications (7%) worldwide
