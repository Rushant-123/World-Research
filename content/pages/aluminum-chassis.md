# How to Make an Aluminum Chassis

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Rio Tinto](/companies/rio-tinto)
- [Alcoa](/companies/alcoa)



An aluminum chassis is the main structural body of a laptop, machined from a single block of aluminum using CNC (computer numerical control) milling. Apple pioneered the unibody design which is stronger and lighter than assembled metal parts.

## What is it?

A precision-machined enclosure made from aluminum alloy (typically 6061-T6), serving as both the structural frame and outer surface of a laptop. The unibody design means the entire top case (including keyboard area) and bottom case are each milled from single blocks, rather than assembled from multiple pieces.

## Steps to Make:

**Material Preparation:**
1. Receive [Aluminum Billet](aluminum-billet) - solid rectangular block of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy
2. Typical billet size: 30cm × 20cm × 5cm, weighs 3-4 kg
3. Aluminum 6061 composition: 97.9% aluminum, 1% magnesium, 0.6% silicon, 0.3% copper, 0.2% chromium
4. T6 temper means it's been solution heat-treated and artificially aged for strength
5. Inspect billet for defects, cracks, or inclusions
6. Clean billet surface with degreaser to remove oil

**CNC Milling Setup:**
7. Load billet into [CNC Milling Machine](cnc-machine) - 5-axis machining center
8. Secure billet in vacuum chuck or mechanical clamps on machine table
9. Install [Cutting Tools](carbide-cutting-tools) - carbide end mills in tool changer (20-40 different tools)
10. Tools include: roughing mills (remove bulk material), finishing mills (smooth surfaces), drills, thread mills
11. Load CAD/CAM program defining exact toolpaths - generated from 3D model
12. Set up [Coolant Fluid](cutting-coolant) system - water-based or oil-based coolant
13. Coolant prevents overheating, lubricates cutting, washes away chips

**Roughing Operations:**
14. [Factory Workers](machinist-labor) start CNC program
15. Machine automatically selects first roughing tool (12mm carbide end mill)
16. Spindle spins tool at 8,000-12,000 RPM
17. Tool plunges into aluminum and begins removing material
18. Machine follows programmed toolpath, moving in X, Y, and Z axes
19. Remove interior sections where components will mount
20. Mill out keyboard cavity (depression where keys sit)
21. Create mounting bosses (raised posts with threaded holes)
22. Machine battery bay, speaker chambers, cooling channels
23. Roughing removes 70-80% of material - up to 2kg of aluminum chips
24. Coolant continuously sprays on cutting area, temperature stays below 100°C
25. Roughing takes 30-45 minutes per part

**Finishing Operations:**
26. CNC automatically changes to smaller finishing tools (3-6mm end mills)
27. Finishing cuts remove 0.1-0.5mm to achieve final dimensions
28. Machine walls to precise thickness: 1.5-2.5mm (thin but strong)
29. Create screw holes with exact positions (tolerance ±0.05mm)
30. Mill USB-C port openings with precise rectangular profiles
31. Create speaker grilles - arrays of small holes (0.5-1mm diameter)
32. Machine hinge mounting points with exact angles
33. Create trackpad opening with smooth edges
34. Mill rubber foot mounting holes
35. Finishing takes 20-30 minutes per part

**Drilling Operations:**
38. CNC changes to drill bits for precise hole making
39. Drill screw holes to exact depth (through-holes or blind holes)
40. Use thread mill to cut internal threads (M2, M2.5 screws)
41. Drill cooling vents - patterns of small holes for airflow
42. Chamfer hole edges to prevent sharp corners

**Inspection:**
43. Remove machined chassis from CNC machine
44. Use compressed air to blow away remaining aluminum chips
45. [Inspection Tools](measurement-tools) - calipers, micrometers, CMM (coordinate measuring machine)
46. Measure critical dimensions: overall size, wall thickness, hole positions
47. Check flatness using precision surface plate
48. Inspect for tool marks, burrs, or imperfections
49. Any part outside tolerance (±0.1mm) is rejected

**Deburring:**
50. Manually remove burrs (sharp edges) using files and abrasive tools
51. Tumble chassis in vibratory tumbler with [Polishing Media](polishing-compound) for 2-4 hours
52. Media (ceramic or plastic pellets) smooths surfaces and edges
53. Rinse chassis with water to remove media residue

**Anodizing (Surface Treatment):**
54. Clean chassis thoroughly with alkaline cleaner to remove oils
55. Rinse with deionized water
56. Etch in sodium hydroxide solution to roughen surface microscopically
57. Rinse again
58. Immerse chassis in [Anodizing Tank](anodizing-tank) filled with [Sulfuric Acid](sulfuric-acid) solution (15-20%)
59. Chassis connects to positive electrode (anode), tank has negative electrode (cathode)
60. Apply DC current (12-18 volts) for 30-60 minutes
61. [Electricity](electricity) powers the anodizing process
62. Electrochemical reaction converts surface aluminum into aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃)
63. Oxide layer grows into the metal (not coating on top), thickness 10-25 microns
64. This layer is extremely hard (9 Mohs hardness, nearly diamond-hard) and corrosion-resistant
65. Anodized layer is porous with microscopic holes

**Dyeing:**
66. While pores are open, immerse chassis in [Dye Solution](anodizing-dye) bath
67. For space grey: nickel or tin salt solutions
68. For silver: leave natural clear anodized (no dye)
69. Dye penetrates into oxide layer pores
70. Soak for 10-20 minutes until uniform color achieved
71. Rinse with water

**Sealing:**
72. Immerse in boiling deionized water or steam for 15-30 minutes
73. Hot water causes aluminum oxide to hydrate and swell
74. Pores close, trapping dye inside
75. Creates permanent, fade-resistant color
76. Surface is now scratch-resistant and corrosion-proof

**Final Finishing:**
77. Bead blast or polish exterior surfaces for smooth, matte finish
78. Laser etch logos, serial numbers, regulatory markings
79. Apply protective film to prevent scratches during shipping
80. Final inspection for color uniformity, surface defects, dimension accuracy
81. Package chassis in anti-static bags with foam protection
82. Ship to assembly facility

**Material Yield:**
- Starting billet weight: 3-4 kg
- Finished chassis weight: 0.5-0.8 kg
- Material removed: 75-85% (becomes recyclable aluminum chips)
- Chips are collected, melted, and recycled into new billets

**Production Time:**
- CNC machining: 60-90 minutes per chassis
- Anodizing: 2-3 hours (batch process, 50-100 parts at once)
- Total throughput: 200-400 chassis per machine per day

The unibody aluminum chassis is what gives MacBooks their distinctive solid feel and durability. The process requires precision CNC machining and careful surface treatment to achieve the premium finish Apple is known for.
