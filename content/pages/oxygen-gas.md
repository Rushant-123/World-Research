# How to Make Oxygen Gas

O₂ from [Air](atmospheric-air) via [Cryogenic Distillation](air-separation-plant). Atmosphere: 21% O₂. Boiling point: -183°C. Separates from nitrogen in distillation column. Collected as liquid or gas. [Compression](oxygen-compressor) to 150-200 bar for cylinders.

**Medical Grade:** 99.5% purity. USP (US Pharmacopeia) standard. **Industrial:** 99.5-99.9%. **Uses:** Steel production, chemical synthesis, wastewater treatment, rocket propellant, medical respiration, welding. Price: $0.05-0.20/kg bulk, $1-5/kg cylinder.
