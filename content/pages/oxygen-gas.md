Industrial oxygen - third most produced chemical globally (300 million tonnes/year, 2023). Essential for: steelmaking (55% of demand, basic oxygen furnace, electric arc furnace), chemicals (25%, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, vinyl chloride, methanol, sulfuric acid), medical (10%, respiratory therapy, anesthesia), water/wastewater treatment (5%, aeration, ozone generation), metal cutting/welding (3%, oxy-acetylene, oxy-fuel), pulp/paper bleaching (1%), rocket propulsion (liquid oxygen LOX, 1%). Cryogenic air separation: fractional distillation of liquefied air, separates by boiling point differences (O₂ -183°C, N₂ -196°C, Ar -186°C).

**Step 1-18: [Atmospheric Air](atmospheric-air) Composition and Intake**
Air composition (dry, sea level): nitrogen 78.08%, oxygen 20.95%, argon 0.93%, CO₂ 0.04% (420 ppm, rising), neon 18 ppm, helium 5 ppm, methane 2 ppm, krypton 1 ppm, hydrogen 0.5 ppm, xenon 0.09 ppm, water vapor 0-4% (varies by location/weather, removed before cryogenic processing). **Intake filtration:** Air enters plant through filters (remove particulates >1 µm dust, pollen, insects, paper, industrial emissions). Multi-stage: (1) Coarse filter (50-100 µm, removes large debris), (2) Pre-filter (10-20 µm, synthetic media, fiberglass), (3) Fine filter (1-5 µm, HEPA-grade for critical applications, bag or cartridge filters). Flow rate: 100,000-500,000 Nm³/h (normal cubic meters, 0°C, 1 atm) for large plant (500-2,000 tonnes O₂/day). Intake location: ground-level or elevated (30-50m towers, avoid ground-level pollutants, lower humidity). **Ambient conditions:** Design for -40°C to +50°C, 0-100% humidity. Hot/humid climates require more pre-cooling, drying (higher energy). Cold climates: risk of ice formation in intake, heat tracing.

**Step 19-38: Compression - First Stage [Air Compressor](industrial-compressor)**
Compress air to 5-10 bar (absolute): increases density (easier liquefaction), raises dew point (water/CO₂ condense at higher temperatures, removable before cryogenic section). **Centrifugal compressor:** Most common for large plants (>200 tonnes O₂/day). Axial-centrifugal hybrid: 1-3 axial stages (handle large volume, low pressure rise) + 3-6 centrifugal stages (higher pressure rise, smaller volume). Driven by: electric motor (5-30 MW, synchronous or induction, 3.3-13.8 kV) or gas turbine (aero-derivative, 20-50 MW, cogeneration, exhaust heat for boilers/steam). Speed: 3,000-15,000 rpm (gearbox if motor 1,500-3,600 rpm). Pressure ratio per stage: 1.2-1.8 (total 5-10 bar requires 3-6 stages). Polytropic efficiency: 85-92% (modern designs, aerodynamically optimized impellers). **Intercooling:** Cool compressed air after each stage (removes compression heat, increases density, reduces next stage power). Water-cooled heat exchangers (shell-and-tube, plate-fin, cooling water 20-35°C from cooling towers). Cool to 30-40°C after each stage. **Aftercooling:** Final stage cools to 5-15°C (maximize water condensation). Knockout drums: separate condensed water (gravity separation, 10-30 seconds residence time, drain continuously). Removed water: 10-30 kg/tonne O₂ (depends on ambient humidity). **Power consumption:** 0.18-0.25 kWh/Nm³ air compressed to 6 bar (major energy consumer, 50-60% of air separation unit ASU power).

**Step 39-58: Pre-Purification - Removal of Water, CO₂, and Hydrocarbons**
Trace impurities freeze in cryogenic section (CO₂ sublimes -78.5°C, H₂O freezes 0°C), block passages, foul heat exchangers. Must remove to <1 ppm H₂O, <1 ppm CO₂ (modern ASU specs, older plants <5 ppm). **[Molecular Sieve Adsorbers](zeolite-adsorbent):** Dual-bed system, zeolite adsorbent (13X synthetic zeolite, sodium aluminosilicate, pore size 10 Å, adsorbs H₂O, CO₂, N₂O, hydrocarbons). Each bed: 10-50 m³ volume, packed with 4-8mm zeolite beads, vessel 3-5m diameter, 8-15m tall, carbon steel. **Adsorption cycle:** Compressed air (6 bar, 30-40°C) enters bottom of online bed, flows upward through zeolite (contact time 5-10 seconds). Impurities adsorb (physisorption, van der Waals forces, exothermic, bed temperature rises 10-30°C). Clean air exits top (<1 ppm H₂O, CO₂). Cycle time: 4-12 hours (depends on bed size, impurity loading). **Regeneration:** When saturation approaches (moisture breakthrough monitored by dew point analyzer), switch to offline bed. Regenerate spent bed: heat with waste nitrogen (10-15% of product N₂, heated to 120-200°C in electric heaters or by heat exchange with warm streams), reverse flow (top to bottom), desorbs impurities. Regeneration time: 2-4 hours (heating 1-2 hours, cooling 1-2 hours with cold nitrogen or air). Desorbed impurities vented to atmosphere. Cycle: two beds alternate (one adsorbing, one regenerating), continuous plant operation. **Hydrocarbon removal:** Some designs include activated alumina or activated carbon bed downstream of molecular sieve (removes acetylene C₂H₂ <0.1 ppm, prevents explosion risk in liquid oxygen, acetylene solidifies -82°C, can detonate in LOX). Alternatively, catalytic combustion of hydrocarbons (palladium catalyst, 200-400°C, oxidizes to CO₂ + H₂O, then remove in molecular sieve).

**Step 59-80: Cryogenic Cooling - Heat Exchange and Refrigeration**
Cool compressed, purified air from 30-40°C to -170°C (close to liquefaction temperature, air liquefies -194°C at 1 bar, but at 5-6 bar liquefies -185°C). **Main heat exchanger (MHX):** Aluminum plate-fin heat exchanger (brazed aluminum construction, high surface area 500-1,500 m²/m³, compact, efficient, 98-99% effectiveness). Multiple streams: incoming compressed air cools against outgoing cold product streams (gaseous O₂, N₂, waste nitrogen, returning from distillation columns). Countercurrent flow maximizes heat transfer. Air progressively cools: 30°C → 0°C (water vapor condenses, removed) → -50°C (CO₂ would freeze, already removed in molecular sieve) → -150°C → -170°C (partially liquefies, two-phase mixture ~30% liquid). **Refrigeration generation:** [Turbo-expander](expansion-turbine) (expansion turbine, key component for refrigeration). Extract 20-40% of cooled compressed air at -100°C to -140°C, expand through turbine (pressure drops from 6 bar to 1.3-1.5 bar, adiabatic expansion, temperature drops to -170°C to -185°C, Joule-Thomson effect + work extraction). Expander: radial inflow turbine, aluminum alloy (operate at cryogenic temperatures, 15,000-30,000 rpm), efficiency 80-88% (isentropic). Generates 5-10 MW power (helps drive compressor, reduces net power consumption 10-15%). Expanded cold air returns to MHX, provides refrigeration (cools incoming air). Alternative/additional: Joule-Thomson (JT) valve expansion (throttle air through valve, no work recovery, but simpler, some plants use both expander + JT for fine control). **Cold box:** Entire cryogenic section enclosed in insulated "cold box" (20-50m long, 10-20m wide, 15-30m tall, perlite-insulated vacuum panels or foam insulation, minimize heat ingress from ambient, <0.5% of refrigeration duty lost to ambient heat leak).

**Step 81-105: [Cryogenic Distillation](air-separation-unit) - Double Column System**
Separate O₂, N₂, Ar by boiling point (BP): N₂ -196°C, Ar -186°C, O₂ -183°C. Classical Linde double-column: two distillation columns stacked (high-pressure column HPC, low-pressure column LPC), thermally coupled, invented 1902 by Carl von Linde, still industry standard. **High-pressure column (lower column, HPC):** Operates 5-6 bar, receives partially liquefied air (-170°C, 30% liquid). Distillation: 30-60 trays (sieve trays or structured packing, high-efficiency, pressure drop 5-10 mbar per tray). Liquid descends (heavier O₂-rich, BP -183°C, boils last, accumulates in liquid), vapor rises (lighter N₂-rich, BP -196°C, boils first, concentrates in vapor). Top product: nitrogen vapor (~99% N₂, trace O₂, Ar), condenses in main condenser-reboiler (bottom of LPC). Bottom product: crude liquid oxygen (LOX, 35-40% O₂, 60-65% N₂, remainder Ar, not pure yet, exits as liquid). Side draw: liquid nitrogen (LN₂, 99% N₂) withdrawn from upper tray, flows to LPC. **Low-pressure column (upper column, LPC):** Operates 1.2-1.5 bar (lower pressure shifts boiling points, easier separation, sharper splits). Receives: (1) liquid N₂ from HPC top (reflux for LPC), (2) crude LOX from HPC bottom (feed to LPC bottom). Distillation: 60-100 trays (higher number for better separation, produce 99.5-99.9% O₂). Top product: nitrogen gas (99.5-99.999% N₂, exits as cold gas -190°C, warms in MHX). Bottom product: liquid oxygen (99.5-99.9% O₂, <1% Ar, <0.1% N₂, commercial purity, exits as liquid -183°C or vaporizes to gas). **Main condenser-reboiler:** Connects HPC top to LPC bottom (physical interface between columns). HPC nitrogen vapor (5-6 bar, -185°C) condenses by heat exchange with LPC bottom liquid oxygen (1.2-1.5 bar, -183°C, boils). Aluminum brazed plate-fin heat exchanger or kettle-type (flooded shell, tube bundle). Provides: (1) reflux liquid for both columns (condensed N₂ returns to HPC, also feeds LPC as reflux), (2) reboil for LPC (vaporizes liquid, creates upward vapor flow, drives distillation). Thermal coupling: HPC provides refrigeration for LPC (energy integration, reduces external refrigeration, Linde's key innovation 1902).

**Step 106-128: Argon Recovery (Optional High-Purity Plants)**
Argon: 0.93% of air, BP -186°C (intermediate between O₂ -183°C and N₂ -196°C), concentrates in middle section of LPC. Commercial value: argon used in welding (inert shield gas, TIG/MIG), light bulbs (inert fill gas), semiconductor (sputtering, ion implantation, annealing), double-pane windows (insulation), specialty chemicals. **Argon column (side column):** Extract vapor from LPC middle section (contains 7-12% Ar, 88-93% O₂, "argon-oxygen cut"). Feed to separate argon column (operates 1.2-1.5 bar, same as LPC, 50-80 trays). Distillation: separate Ar (BP -186°C) from O₂ (BP -183°C, small 3°C difference, requires many trays). Top: crude argon (~98% Ar, 2% O₂). Further purification: (1) **Catalytic de-oxygenation:** Add hydrogen (0.5-2% H₂), pass over palladium catalyst (300-400°C), oxygen reacts: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O (removes O₂ to <1 ppm). Cool, condense water. (2) **Re-distillation:** Second argon column, remove trace N₂ (<10 ppm). Final purity: 99.999% Ar (welding-grade) to 99.9999% (semiconductor-grade, "six-nines"). Production: 50-100 kg Ar per tonne O₂ produced (0.5-1 kg per 10 kg air processed, 5-10% recovery efficiency from air, balancing energy cost vs argon value $1-3/kg). Not all ASU plants recover argon (small plants <200 tonne O₂/day often vent, large plants >500 tonne/day typically recover, economies of scale).

**Step 129-145: Product Compression, Storage, and Distribution**
Oxygen exits LPC as: (1) Gaseous oxygen (GOX, 95% of production), or (2) Liquid oxygen (LOX, 5% of production, cryogenic liquid -183°C, stored/transported as liquid). **Gaseous oxygen (GOX) compression:** Product gas exits cold (-175°C, 1.2 bar), warms in MHX (recovers cold, cools incoming air, exits 15-30°C). [Compress to delivery pressure](oxygen-compressor): 10-40 bar (pipeline, on-site bulk), 150-200 bar (cylinders), 300-450 bar (medical cylinders, high-capacity portable). **Compressor types:** Oil-free reciprocating (piston compressor, 3-5 stages with intercooling, for high pressure 150-450 bar), oil-free centrifugal (large flow, low pressure 10-40 bar), booster compressors (if base pressure 6-10 bar from ASU, boost to 150-200 bar). Materials: compatible with high-pressure oxygen (brass, stainless steel 316, avoid aluminum/titanium above 50 bar + 60°C, combustion risk). Cleanliness critical: oxygen-clean assembly (degrease components, no hydrocarbons, oil ignites in high-pressure O₂). **Pipeline delivery:** On-site ASU at customer location (steel plant, chemical plant, hospital), pipeline 10-40 bar, few hundred meters to 10+ km. Flow: 1,000-50,000 Nm³/h (continuous supply, 98-99.5% purity). **Cylinder filling:** Compress to 150-200 bar (industrial cylinders, 40-50 L, contain 7-9 m³ O₂ at 200 bar, weigh 60-70 kg full) or 300 bar (medical, smaller portable). Fill cascade: manifold of cylinders fills simultaneously (200-500 cylinders per batch, automated filling racks). Test: leak check (bubble test, pressure hold), purity analysis (paramagnetic analyzer or electrochemical sensor, 99.5-99.9% medical-grade, 99.5% industrial).

**Step 146-160: Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Production and Transport**
**LOX advantages:** High density (1.14 g/mL vs 1.4 kg/m³ gas at 1 atm, 840× denser), efficient transport (tanker trucks carry 20-40 tonnes LOX, equivalent to 17-35 million liters gas, 300-600 cylinders), long-term storage (vacuum-insulated tanks, minimal loss). **LOX production:** Withdraw liquid from LPC bottom sump (-183°C, 1.2 bar), pump to higher pressure (10-50 bar, cryogenic centrifugal pump, stainless steel or aluminum), keep below 15-20 bar if storing long-term (lower pressure reduces heat ingress, less boil-off). **Storage tanks:** Vacuum-insulated (double-wall, evacuated annular space <10⁻⁴ mbar vacuum, reduces conductive/convective heat transfer), perlite or multi-layer insulation (MLI, aluminized mylar sheets, reduces radiant heat). Spherical or cylindrical (vertical, 50-1,000 m³ capacity, 316L stainless steel inner vessel). Boil-off rate: 0.1-0.5% per day (evaporation from ambient heat ingress, 100 m³ tank loses 100-500 liters/day, vented as gas or re-liquefied). Pressure relief: vent to atmosphere if pressure exceeds 10-15 bar (safety, prevent tank rupture). **Transport:** Cryogenic tanker trucks (vacuum-insulated trailer, 20-40 m³ capacity, 20-40 tonnes LOX, 18-wheel tractor-trailer). Tanker construction: stainless steel inner tank, carbon steel outer jacket, perlite insulation, pressure 10-15 bar. Delivery: pump LOX from tanker to customer storage tank (cryogenic transfer pump or pressure differential, 100-500 L/min flow). Fill cylinders on-site (vaporize LOX, compress to 150-200 bar, fill cascade). **ISO containers:** 20-40 ft cryogenic containers (20,000-40,000 L, ship by rail, truck, or cargo ship, international transport). **Barges/ships:** Very large deliveries (1,000-10,000 tonnes, rare, mostly coastal regions, bulk LOX/LN₂/argon).

**Step 161-175: Medical Oxygen - Purity and Certification**
**Medical-grade oxygen:** 99.5% minimum O₂ (USP United States Pharmacopeia, EP European Pharmacopoeia standards). Impurities: <300 ppm N₂ + Ar (combined), <5 ppm CO, <5 ppm CO₂, <67 ppm H₂O (dew point -51°C at 1 atm), <0.1 ppm hydrocarbons (as methane equivalent), no odor. **Production:** Same cryogenic process as industrial O₂, but: (1) Additional purification: final filter (removes particulates >0.2 µm, bacterial filter if needed), moisture polishing (molecular sieve desiccant dryer if dew point not met). (2) Dedicated equipment: separate compressors, cylinders, filling manifolds (avoid cross-contamination with industrial gas). (3) Quality control: batch testing (every batch, typically 200-500 cylinders, test for O₂ %, impurities, moisture, CO), certificate of analysis (CoA, accompanies each batch). (4) Traceability: cylinder labeling (batch number, fill date, expiry, purity), track to patient (medical device, FDA/EMA regulated). **Cylinder marking:** White shoulders (USA, international standard ISO 32), black body (USA older standard), fully white (Europe), labeled "Oxygen USP," hazard warning "Oxidizer," CAS number 7782-44-7. Pressure: 300 bar (USA, 2,216 psi), 200 bar (Europe, 2,900 psi), medical cylinders size D (12 L), E (22 L), M (40 L), H (50 L). **Certification:** Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP, pharmaceutical-grade production), ISO 13485 (medical device quality management), FDA registration (USA, Establishment License, NDA or ANDA for drug approval, oxygen classified as drug), EMA authorization (Europe, Marketing Authorization), annual inspections. **Uses:** Respiratory therapy (COPD, emphysema, asthma, pneumonia, COVID-19), anesthesia (mixed with nitrous oxide N₂O or volatile agents), emergency medicine (cardiac arrest, trauma, shock), hyperbaric chambers (decompression sickness, wound healing, 2-3 atm 100% O₂), neonatal incubators (premature infants, 30-40% O₂ enriched air). Consumption: 10-15 million tonnes/year medical O₂ (10% of global production).

**Step 176-185: Industrial Applications - Steelmaking**
**Basic oxygen furnace (BOF):** Primary steelmaking (70% of global steel, 1.3 billion tonnes/year). Charge: molten pig iron from blast furnace (4-5% carbon, 0.5-2% silicon, 0.5-1% manganese, 0.05-0.1% sulfur, 0.1-0.4% phosphorus) + scrap steel (10-30%). Inject pure O₂ (99.5%) through water-cooled lance (submerged or top-blown, 300-500 Nm³/min, 10-15 bar, 20-40 minutes). Reactions: C + O₂ → CO₂ (exothermic, -394 kJ/mol, generates heat, maintains 1,600-1,700°C), Si + O₂ → SiO₂ (forms slag), Mn + O₂ → MnO (slag), P + O₂ → P₂O₅ (slag removal critical, brittle steel), S + CaO → CaS (desulfurization, lime flux added). Result: low-carbon steel (<0.1-2% C, mild or carbon steel), decarburization 4% → <0.1% in 20-40 minutes. O₂ consumption: 50-60 Nm³ per tonne steel (60-70 kg O₂ per tonne, largest single application, 55% of industrial O₂). **Electric arc furnace (EAF):** Scrap steel melting (30% of global steel, mini-mills, 500 Mt/year). Inject O₂ (oxy-fuel burners, lancing, 50-150 Nm³/min) to: (1) Cut scrap (oxy-fuel lance, preheat, accelerate melting), (2) Decarburize (remove residual carbon from scrap), (3) Provide heat (C + O₂ combustion, supplements electric arc, reduces electricity 50-100 kWh/tonne, 10-15% energy savings). O₂ consumption: 20-40 Nm³ per tonne steel. **Total steelmaking:** 1.9 Gt steel/year × 40-50 Nm³ O₂/tonne = 80-95 Gm³/year O₂ (100-120 Mt/year, 55% of O₂ production).

**Step 186-195: Economics, Energy, and Market**
Global oxygen production: 300 million tonnes/year (2023, as pure O₂, excludes air). China: 120 Mt (40%), USA: 30 Mt (10%), India: 25 Mt (8%), EU: 25 Mt (8%), Japan: 15 Mt (5%), other 85 Mt (29%). Production mode: (1) On-site plants (60% of production, cryogenic ASU at customer location, steel mills, chemical plants, hospitals, capacity 50-5,000 tonnes O₂/day, pipeline delivery). (2) Merchant liquid (35%, central ASU, LOX delivered by tanker truck/railcar to multiple customers, capacity 200-2,000 tonnes/day, flexible). (3) Cylinders (5%, high-purity, small users, medical, laboratories, welding shops). **Price:** Bulk on-site $50-100/tonne (pipeline, long-term contract, 15-20 years, cost-plus), merchant liquid $100-300/tonne (spot or short-term, includes transport), cylinders $1,000-5,000/tonne ($1-5/kg, includes filling, handling, rental, small volume premium), medical cylinders $2-10/kg (regulatory, quality, traceability). **Energy consumption:** 0.35-0.50 kWh/Nm³ O₂ (250-350 kWh/tonne, cryogenic ASU, depends on purity, argon recovery, plant size, older plants 400-500 kWh/tonne). Energy breakdown: air compression 55-60%, refrigeration (expander/JT) 20-25%, O₂ compression 10-15%, nitrogen compression 5%, auxiliary (controls, cooling towers, molecular sieve regeneration) 5%. Large plants more efficient (economies of scale, 2,000 tonne/day plant 280 kWh/tonne vs 500 tonne/day plant 400 kWh/tonne). **Alternative: PSA (pressure swing adsorption):** Small-scale O₂ generation (1-100 tonnes/day, on-site hospitals, small industries). Adsorb N₂ on zeolite at 5-10 bar (N₂ preferentially adsorbs, O₂ passes through), produce 90-95% O₂ (not as pure as cryogenic, suitable for medical 93% + concentrator, combustion). Energy: 0.4-0.6 kWh/Nm³ O₂ (less efficient than large cryogenic, but lower capex, modular, quick install). Capex: PSA $500k-2M (50-100 tonne/day), cryogenic ASU $50M-200M (500-2,000 tonne/day, economies of scale). **VPSA (vacuum PSA):** Enhanced PSA, vacuum regeneration (lower desorption pressure, better N₂ removal), 0.3-0.4 kWh/Nm³, gaining market share. **Membrane:** Polymer membrane (hollow fiber, selective N₂ permeation), produce 30-50% O₂ (enriched air, not pure O₂), niche applications (combustion enhancement, aquaculture). Future: oxy-combustion carbon capture (O₂ + fuel → CO₂ + H₂O, no N₂ dilution, pure CO₂ capture for CCS), steel industry decarbonization (H₂-based direct reduction + EAF, reduces O₂ demand but increases H₂), medical O₂ shortages (COVID-19 pandemic drove PSA/VPSA installations, 2020-2021 surge, ongoing capacity additions in developing countries).

Price: $0.30/kg ($300/tonne) represents bulk merchant liquid oxygen, mid-range estimate. Used in: steelmaking (BOF, EAF, largest demand 55%), chemicals (ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, vinyl chloride monomer, terephthalic acid, methanol, hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, 25%), medical (respiratory therapy, anesthesia, 10%), wastewater treatment (aeration, biological treatment, ozone generation, 5%), metal fabrication (oxy-fuel cutting, welding, 3%), pulp/paper bleaching (chlorine dioxide, oxygen delignification, 1%), aquaculture (aeration, fish farming, 0.5%), rocket propulsion (LOX, space launch, 0.5%). Per tonne steel: 50-60 Nm³ O₂ = 70-85 kg O₂ = $21-25.5 oxygen cost component. Per chip: indirect via steel equipment frames, chemical precursors (trace, negligible direct cost allocation).
