1. Geologic mapping identifies chromite layers in mafic intrusions
2. Core drilling confirms chromium oxide content (42-46% Cr2O3)
3. Shaft sinking to depths of 300-1000 meters
4. Main haulage developed at ore horizon
5. Cross-cuts driven perpendicular to ore body
6. Stope panels designed 30m wide by 100m long
7. Uphole drilling creates blast rings
8. Emulsion explosives charged into holes
9. Top-down retreat mining sequence
10. Blasted ore falls to collection drives
11. LHD loaders scoop and transport ore
12. Underground crushing station reduces size
13. Conveyor belt transports to shaft
14. Hoisting to surface in 10-ton skips
15. Surface stockpiling by grade
16. Dense media separation for beneficiation
17. Ferrosilicon media at specific gravity 2.8
18. Chromite sinks (SG 4.5), gangue floats
19. Spiral concentrators provide secondary upgrade
20. Washing removes clay and fine silica
21. Magnetic separation removes magnetic iron oxides
22. Final concentrate: 44-46% Cr2O3
23. Chromium-to-iron ratio optimized (1.5:1 to 2:1)
24. Sizing into lump (6-100mm) and fines (<6mm)
25. Rotary dryer reduces moisture to <3%
26. Quality control for alumina and silica content
27. Stockpiling in weatherproof facility
28. Rail transport to ferrochrome smelter
29. Ventilation system delivers fresh air underground
30. Rock support with shotcrete and mesh
31. Dewatering pumps handle groundwater inflow
32. Safety monitoring for ground movement
33. Workforce training in confined space rescue
34. Production rate: 2-4 million tons per year
35. Mine life typically 15-30 years
