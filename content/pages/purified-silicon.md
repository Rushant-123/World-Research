# How to Make Purified Silicon

Purified silicon (polysilicon) is ultra-pure silicon in polycrystalline form, containing 99.9999999% (nine nines) pure silicon. It's the raw material for making silicon wafers used in computer chips and solar panels.

## What is it?

Silicon that has been refined from sand to an extreme level of purity. Starting from ordinary sand (silicon dioxide, SiO2), impurities are removed through chemical processes until only silicon atoms remain. This material looks like grey or silver chunks or rods.

## Steps to Make:

1. Start with [Quartzite Sand](quartzite-sand) (silicon dioxide, SiO2) mined from quarries
2. Transport the sand to a refining facility
3. Load sand and [Carbon Electrodes](carbon-electrodes) into an [Electric Arc Furnace](electric-arc-furnace)
4. Heat the furnace to 2,000°C (3,600°F) using [Electricity](electricity)
5. Ask an adult to help as this process is extremely hot and dangerous
6. The carbon reacts with silicon dioxide: SiO2 + 2C → Si + 2CO
7. This produces "metallurgical-grade silicon" (98% pure) as a liquid
8. Drain the molten silicon and let it solidify into chunks
9. Grind the solid silicon into powder
10. Mix the silicon powder with [Hydrochloric Acid](hydrochloric-acid) (HCl)
11. Heat the mixture to create trichlorosilane gas (SiHCl3)
12. The reaction is: Si + 3HCl → SiHCl3 + H2
13. Use [Distillation Equipment](distillation-equipment) to purify the trichlorosilane gas
14. Distill multiple times to remove any impurity molecules
15. Now you have ultra-pure trichlorosilane gas
16. Pump the gas into a [Siemens Reactor](siemens-reactor) - a chamber with heated silicon rods
17. Introduce [Hydrogen Gas](hydrogen-gas) into the reactor
18. Heat the rods to 1,100°C (2,000°F) with electricity
19. The gases react on the hot rod surface: SiHCl3 + H2 → Si + 3HCl
20. Pure silicon deposits onto the rods, making them grow thicker
21. Continue for several days until the rods are 150-200mm diameter
22. [Factory Workers](chemical-workers) monitor the process and maintain equipment
23. Turn off the heat and let the rods cool
24. Remove the thick silicon rods from the reactor
25. Break the rods into smaller chunks using a hammer or saw
26. Inspect the chunks for purity using spectrographic analysis
27. Package the pure silicon chunks for shipping to wafer manufacturers

The result is polycrystalline silicon pure enough for making computer chips - the starting point for all modern electronics. The entire purification process from sand to polysilicon involves over 99.9% removal of impurities.
