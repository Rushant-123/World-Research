# How to Make Purified Silicon

Purified silicon (polysilicon) is ultra-pure silicon in polycrystalline form, containing 99.9999999% (nine nines) pure silicon. It's the raw material for making silicon wafers used in computer chips and solar panels.

## What is it?

Silicon that has been refined from sand to an extreme level of purity. Starting from ordinary sand (silicon dioxide, SiO2), impurities are removed through chemical processes until only silicon atoms remain. This material looks like grey or silver chunks or rods.

## Steps to Make:

**Metallurgical Silicon Production:**
1. Mine [Quartzite Sand](quartzite-sand) (SiO2, >98% silicon dioxide) from quarries
2. Transport quartzite and [Coke (Carbon)](metallurgical-coke) to refinery facility
3. Also obtain [Wood Chips](wood-chips) as additional carbon source
4. [Factory Workers](chemical-workers) prepare the [Arc Furnace](electric-arc-furnace)
5. Line the furnace with [Refractory Bricks](refractory-lining) that can withstand 2,000°C+
6. Load furnace with mixture: 1 ton quartzite + 500kg coke + 100kg wood chips
7. Insert three [Graphite Electrodes](graphite-electrodes) (each 1 meter long) through furnace roof
8. Seal the furnace
9. Apply high [Electricity](electricity) current (up to 50,000 amps) to electrodes
10. Electric arc forms between electrodes, generating 2,000-2,500°C temperature
11. Ask an adult to help as this process is extremely dangerous with intense heat and electric arcs
12. The intense heat drives carbothermic reduction reaction: SiO₂ + 2C → Si + 2CO
13. Silicon dioxide melts and carbon reduces it to silicon metal
14. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) escapes through exhaust system
15. Process runs continuously for 6-8 hours per batch
16. Liquid silicon (melting point 1,414°C) collects at furnace bottom
17. Tap the furnace - drain molten silicon into molds
18. Let silicon solidify over 12 hours - forms shiny grey metallic blocks
19. Result: Metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si), 98-99% pure
20. Break blocks into chunks using hydraulic press
21. This material is not pure enough for semiconductors - contains metals, carbon, oxygen

**Grinding and Hydrochlorination:**
22. Transport MG-Si chunks to purification facility
23. Feed chunks into [Crusher Machine](crusher-equipment) to break into gravel-sized pieces
24. Use [Ball Mill](ball-mill) to grind silicon into fine powder (50-100 microns)
25. Load silicon powder into [Reactor Vessel](chemical-reactor) (fluidized bed reactor)
26. Heat reactor to 300-400°C using electric heating elements
27. Inject [Hydrochloric Acid](hydrochloric-acid) gas (HCl) into reactor
28. Add trace amounts of [Copper Catalyst](copper-catalyst) to speed reaction
29. Silicon reacts with HCl: Si + 3HCl → SiHCl₃ + H₂
30. This produces trichlorosilane (TCS) gas plus hydrogen
31. TCS is a colorless liquid at room temp (boiling point 31.8°C), gas at reactor temp
32. Reaction is exothermic - releases heat
33. Continue flowing HCl through reactor for 8-12 hours until silicon is consumed
34. Collect TCS gas through condenser - cools it to liquid

**Distillation (Multiple Stages):**
35. TCS liquid contains impurities: boron compounds, phosphorus compounds, metal chlorides
36. Pump TCS into first [Distillation Column](distillation-equipment) (fractionating tower)
37. Heat the column base to 50°C with [Heat Exchangers](heat-exchanger)
38. TCS vaporizes and rises through column
39. Different impurities condense at different heights based on boiling points
40. High-purity TCS exits at specific point in column
41. Impurities drain from top and bottom as separate fractions
42. Feed purified TCS into second distillation column for additional purification
43. Then third distillation column for final purification
44. Each distillation step removes 90-99% of remaining impurities
45. After triple distillation: TCS purity exceeds 99.9999999% (9 nines)
46. Boron and phosphorus levels now below 0.01 parts per billion
47. Store ultra-pure TCS in stainless steel tanks under [High-Purity Argon](argon-gas) atmosphere

**Siemens Process (CVD Deposition):**
48. Transfer ultra-pure TCS to [Siemens Reactor](siemens-reactor) - a bell jar chamber
49. Mount [Slim Rods](starter-rods) (seed rods, 6mm diameter, made of pure silicon) vertically in reactor
50. Typical reactor has 24-48 rods in a circular arrangement
51. Seal the reactor and evacuate air
52. Fill with inert gas ([High-Purity Argon](argon-gas)) to prevent oxidation
53. Pass electric current through the slim rods to heat them via resistance heating
54. Heat rods to 1,100-1,150°C (they glow red-hot)
55. Temperature must be precise ±10°C
56. Begin flowing ultra-pure TCS gas into reactor
57. Also inject [Hydrogen Gas](hydrogen-gas) (molar ratio H₂:TCS = 3:1 to 10:1)
58. At hot rod surface, reverse reaction occurs: SiHCl₃ + H₂ → Si + 3HCl
59. Pure silicon atoms deposit onto hot rods, building up layer by layer
60. Silicon grows radially - rods get thicker
61. Byproduct HCl gas exits reactor through exhaust
62. HCl is recycled back to hydrochlorination step (closed loop)
63. Growth rate: 0.8-1.2 mm per hour
64. As rods thicken, electrical resistance changes - adjust current to maintain temperature
65. Continue deposition for 60-100 hours
66. Rods grow from 6mm to 150-250mm diameter
67. Final rods are 1-2 meters tall, weigh 40-80 kg each
68. One reactor batch produces 1-2 tons of polysilicon
69. [Factory Workers](chemical-workers) monitor temperature, gas flows, and rod resistance continuously

**Cooling and Harvesting:**
70. Shut off TCS and hydrogen gas flows
71. Turn off heating current
72. Allow rods to cool slowly in argon atmosphere over 24 hours
73. Rapid cooling would cause thermal stress and cracking
74. Open reactor once rods reach room temperature
75. Remove the thick polysilicon rods - they have rough, faceted surface texture
76. Polysilicon is polycrystalline - composed of many small crystal grains

**Quality Control:**
77. Break off sample pieces from rods
78. Use [Spectrometer](spectrometer) to analyze impurity concentrations
79. Measure resistivity using four-point probe
80. Target specifications:
    - Purity: 99.9999999% (9 nines) or better
    - Boron: < 0.3 ppba (parts per billion atomic)
    - Phosphorus: < 0.2 ppba
    - Carbon: < 0.5 ppm
    - Metals (Fe, Al, Cu, etc.): < 0.1 ppba each
81. Electronic-grade polysilicon must meet these specs
82. Solar-grade polysilicon has relaxed specs (6-7 nines purity, cheaper)

**Final Processing:**
83. Use hydraulic crusher to break rods into chunks (fist-sized)
84. Inspect chunks visually - remove any with discoloration or contamination
85. Clean chunks with ultra-pure water rinse
86. Dry in clean oven under nitrogen atmosphere
87. Package chunks in polyethylene bags under nitrogen
88. Seal bags in airtight containers
89. Label with lot number, purity specifications, production date
90. Ship to wafer manufacturers (Shin-Etsu, Sumco, Siltronic) or directly to fabs

**Industry Scale:**
- Global production: 600,000-800,000 tons per year
- Main producers: China (80%), Germany, USA, Japan
- Energy consumption: 50-80 kWh per kg of polysilicon (very energy-intensive)
- Process time: 3-5 days from MG-Si to finished polysilicon
- Yield: 95-98% (some material lost to side reactions)

The Siemens process has been used since 1950s and produces highest-purity silicon available. Alternative methods (fluidized bed reactor) are faster but slightly less pure. The entire purification chain from sand (99% SiO₂) to polysilicon (99.9999999% Si) achieves 10 million-fold reduction in impurity concentration.
