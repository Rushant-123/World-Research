1. Geophysical surveys locate copper porphyry deposits
2. Core drilling confirms ore grade (0.3-1.5% copper)
3. Mine planning determines optimal pit layout
4. Drill blast pattern designed for 15m bench height
5. Rotary drill rigs bore 12-inch diameter blastholes
6. Holes drilled to 16m depth in 30-minute cycles
7. ANFO explosives loaded into blastholes (200kg per hole)
8. Electronic detonators programmed for sequential firing
9. Controlled blast fragments 400,000 tons of rock
10. Excavators load 20-ton buckets of blasted ore
11. Material loaded into 320-ton capacity haul trucks
12. Grade control sensors scan each truck load
13. High-grade ore (>0.7% Cu) directed to primary crusher
14. Low-grade ore (0.3-0.7% Cu) stockpiled for later processing
15. Waste rock (<0.3% Cu) dumped in designated areas
16. Primary gyratory crusher reduces ore to <200mm
17. Conveyor system transports crushed ore 5km to concentrator
18. Semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill reduces size to <10mm

21. Concentrate contains 25-30% copper
22. Tailings (waste) pumped to storage facility
23. Thickeners recover water from tailings (90% recycling rate)
24. XRF analyzers verify concentrate grade every hour
25. Moisture content reduced to 8-9% in filter presses
26. Concentrate stockpiled in weatherproof storage
27. Rail cars transport concentrate to smelter
28. Pit dewatering pumps remove 5,000 gallons/minute
29. Haul road maintenance for 24/7 operations
30. Tire changes on haul trucks every 6 months (cost $40,000 per tire)
31. Equipment refueling from mobile fuel trucks
32. Shift changes at 6am, 2pm, 10pm for continuous operation
33. Environmental monitoring of dust and noise levels
34. Wildlife corridors maintained around pit perimeter
35. Workforce of 1,500 per mine site
36. Production rate: 150,000 tons of ore per day
37. Mine life typically 30-50 years
38. Progressive rehabilitation of mined areas
