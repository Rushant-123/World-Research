# How to Make Copper Ore

Extract copper-bearing rock from the Earth. Copper essential for electronics (wiring, PCBs, chip interconnects), construction (plumbing, roofing), transportation (electric vehicles use 3-4× more copper than ICE vehicles). Grade: 0.5-2% Cu in ore (mine 100 tonnes ore → extract 0.5-2 tonnes copper metal). Porphyry deposits most important: disseminated low-grade ore in intrusive igneous rocks, very large tonnage (billion+ tonnes).

**Step 1-12: Geological Exploration and Discovery**
Copper deposits form by hydrothermal processes. Magma intrudes into crust (subduction zones - Pacific Ring of Fire), releases hot metal-rich fluids (400-700°C). Fluids deposit sulfide minerals in fractures: chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂, 34.6% Cu), bornite (Cu₅FeS₄, 63% Cu), chalcocite (Cu₂S, 80% Cu). Supergene enrichment: weathering concentrates copper near surface (secondary enrichment zone 50-300m below surface, 2-5% Cu vs primary ore 0.3-0.8% Cu). Exploration: satellite imagery (alteration halos, vegetation stress), airborne geophysics (magnetics - detect magnetite associated with porphyry, electromagnetics - conductive sulfides), geochemical sampling (soil, rock, stream sediment), geological mapping, trenching, core drilling. Typical discovery: 10-20 years exploration, $50-200M spent, success rate 1 in 1,000 prospects becomes mine. Example: Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia (discovered 2001, production 2013, cost $6.75B).

**Step 13-28: Mine Permitting and Development**
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS): assess air quality, water resources, wildlife, cultural heritage. Public comment period. Permits: mining permit, water discharge permit, air quality permit, explosives permit. Process: 3-10 years in developed countries (USA, Australia, Canada), 1-3 years in developing countries. Community engagement: negotiate impact benefits agreement with local communities, indigenous groups. Concerns: water usage (3-5 m³ water/tonne ore in arid regions), tailings storage (100,000-1,000,000 tonnes/day waste rock), truck traffic, dust, noise, acid mine drainage. Mitigation: dry stack tailings, water recycling (>90% recycle rate), dust suppression, sound barriers, seepage collection systems. Capital cost: $1-15 billion for large mine (world-class deposit >5 million tonnes copper). Construction: 3-5 years. Workforce: 2,000-10,000 construction workers, 500-2,000 operational employees.

**Step 29-45: [Open Pit Mining](mining-operations) Operations**
Majority of copper: open pit (vs underground). Remove overburden (waste rock above ore). Stripping ratio: 1:1 to 4:1 (tonnes waste:ore). Drill pattern: rotary blast-hole drills (200-350mm diameter holes), grid pattern 8-15m spacing, depth 15-20m (bench height). Drill penetration rate: 20-60 m/hour in soft rock, 10-30 m/hour in hard rock. [Explosives loading](anfo-explosives): ANFO (ammonium nitrate 94%, fuel oil 6%) for bulk loading (pneumatic truck pumps explosive into hole). Powder factor: 0.3-0.8 kg explosive/tonne rock. Detonation: electronic detonators with millisecond delays (sequence blast, control vibration, optimize fragmentation). Blast: 100,000-500,000 tonnes per blast. Fragmentation target: 80% passing 300-800mm (size for loading equipment).

**Step 46-62: Material Handling**
Load blasted rock: hydraulic [excavators](hydraulic-excavator) (shovel) with 20-70 m³ buckets. Cycle time: 30-45 seconds (load 4-8 buckets per truck). Haul to crusher or waste dump: [mining trucks](mining-trucks) - Caterpillar 797F (400 tonne payload), Komatsu 980E-4 (360 tonne), or ultra-class trucks (Liebherr T 284, 400 tonne). Truck speed: loaded 15-40 km/h uphill, 30-60 km/h downhill (retarders control speed), 50-80 km/h flat. Haul distance: 1-5 km average. Cycle time: 30-60 minutes (load, haul, dump, return). Fleet size: 50-200 trucks for large mine. Fuel consumption: 200-400 liters/hour per truck (diesel). Ore to crusher: tip into grizzly feeder. Waste to dump: tip over edge of waste rock pile (builds 100-300m high dumps).

**Step 63-78: Primary Crushing**
Gyratory crusher: cone-shaped crushing head gyrates in conical cavity. Feed size: 1,500mm, product size: 150-300mm. Crushing ratio: 5:1 to 8:1. Capacity: 1,000-10,000 tonnes/hour. Crusher dimensions: 1.5-2m mantle diameter, 10-15m tall total. Motor power: 500-2,000 kW. Jaw crusher (alternative for smaller operations): feed 1,000mm, product 100-200mm. Conveyor system: crushed ore to stockpile (surge capacity 10,000-50,000 tonnes, buffer between mining and milling). Belt conveyors: 1.2-2.4m wide, 2-6 m/s speed, 1,000-10,000 tonne/hour capacity. Overland conveyors: 1-15 km long (transport from pit to mill, avoid truck haulage). Regenerative conveyors: downhill conveyors generate electricity (braking), feed grid (reduce mine power consumption 10-20%).

**Step 79-95: Challenges and Optimization**
Pit slope stability: geotechnical analysis (rock mass rating, groundwater pressure, discontinuities), slope angle 35-50° (steeper = less waste, but higher risk). Slope monitoring: prisms + total stations (measure movement mm-scale, daily), radar (real-time monitoring, detect acceleration). Slope failures: buttress with waste rock, dewater (drill horizontal drains), reduce angle. Water management: pit dewatering (pumps remove 500-5,000 L/s groundwater, prevent pit flooding), mine water treatment (pH 2-4 from acid rock drainage, neutralize with lime, precipitate metals, discharge or reuse). Haulage optimization: dispatch system (GPS + algorithms assign trucks to shovels, minimize wait times, maximize utilization). Shovel utilization target: >85%. Truck utilization: 80-85%. Equipment availability: 85-92% (balance maintenance vs production). Grade control: blast-hole sampling (assay cuttings every 3m), short-range blasting (separate ore blocks by grade), GPS on trucks (route high-grade to mill, low-grade to leach pad, waste to dump). Dilution: mixing of waste with ore (reduces mill feed grade), target <5% dilution. Ore loss: high-grade ore sent to waste dump (errors in grade control), target <2% loss.

**Step 96-110: Life of Mine**
Typical mine life: 20-50 years (large deposits). Production rate: 20,000-500,000 tonnes ore/day. Annual copper production: 100,000-1,000,000 tonnes Cu metal. Pit expansion: sequential pushbacks (widen pit, push back walls, maintain safe slopes, access deeper ore). Final pit depth: 500-1,500m below surface (e.g., Chuquicamata, Chile 1,000m deep, transitioning to underground). Transition: open pit → underground (block caving or panel caving method) when stripping ratio becomes uneconomic (>4:1 or >6:1 depending on copper price). Resource depletion: ore grade declines over time (mine high-grade zones first, low-grade later), grade decline 0.01-0.03% Cu/year typical. Processing adjusts: optimize recovery, reduce costs.

**Step 111-125: By-Products and Co-Products**
Copper ores contain valuable by-products: molybdenum (MoS₂, 0.01-0.05% Mo in porphyry deposits, separate by flotation, price $20-60/kg, adds 10-30% of revenue). Gold and silver (0.1-1 g/t Au, 2-20 g/t Ag, recovered in smelting and refining, adds 5-15% revenue). Rhenium (trace in molybdenite, 0.001-0.002% Re, extremely rare, $1,000-3,000/kg, used in superalloys for jet engines). Selenium and tellurium (recovered from smelter residues). Sulfuric acid (from SO₂ emissions during smelting, 2-3 tonnes H₂SO₄ per tonne Cu, sold to phosphate fertilizer industry or returned for leaching).

**Step 126-140: Economics and Market**
Copper price (2010-2024): $5,000-10,000/tonne, average $7,500/tonne. Breakeven cost: $3,000-6,000/tonne (90th percentile of cost curve ~$6,000, i.e., price below $6,000 → 10% of mines unprofitable). Cost breakdown: mining 30-40%, milling and flotation 20-30%, smelting and refining 20-30%, administration and overhead 10-20%. Open pit mining cost: $2-8/tonne ore moved (including drilling, blasting, loading, hauling). Underground mining cost: $30-100/tonne ore (10-30× more expensive than open pit). Ore grade critical: 1% Cu ore at $1,500/tonne Cu revenue after smelting/refining → revenue $15/tonne ore. Mining cost $3/tonne, milling $8/tonne, G&A $2/tonne → total cost $13/tonne → margin $2/tonne. At 0.5% Cu ore: revenue $7.5/tonne, cost $13/tonne → loss $5.5/tonne unless costs reduced or price higher. Economy of scale: larger mines have lower unit costs (20,000 t/d operation $13-18/tonne cost, 200,000 t/d operation $8-12/tonne).

**Step 141-150: Global Production and Reserves**
Global mine production (2023): 22 million tonnes copper. Major producers: Chile 5.2M tonnes (24% of world, Escondida mine 1.0M tonnes/year largest), Peru 2.7M, China 1.9M, Congo (DRC) 1.9M, USA 1.2M, Australia 0.9M, Zambia 0.8M, Russia 0.8M, Mexico 0.8M, Indonesia 0.7M. Reserves: 890 million tonnes copper (at current consumption rate, 40 years supply, but new discoveries and improved extraction technology extend this). Deposit types: porphyry copper (60% of production), sediment-hosted stratiform (Zambian Copperbelt, 20%), volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS, 10%), other (10%). Copper intensity: global use 25 kg/person/year (USA 10 kg, China 8 kg, India 1 kg). Electric vehicle: 83 kg copper (vs 23 kg in gasoline car). Wind turbine: 2.5-6 tonnes copper per MW capacity. Solar: 5 tonnes/MW. Energy transition: demand increase 30-60% by 2040 (require 15-30 new large mines, difficult due to permitting, declining grades, resource nationalism).

Price: $1/kg ($1,000/tonne) represents ore value at mine (0.7% Cu grade, copper price $7,500/tonne → 0.007 × $7,500 = $52.50/tonne ore revenue, minus 90% processing cost → ~$5/tonne ore net value, but in supply chain context $1 represents simplified input cost including extraction). Actual ore at mine gate: $0.05-0.20 per kg ore depending on grade and costs. The $1 value is normalized for supply chain model representing copper ore input cost per unit mass entering concentration process.
