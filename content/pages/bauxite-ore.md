1. Geological surveys identify bauxite deposits in weathered tropical soils
2. Environmental impact assessments conducted for mining permits
3. Forest clearing and topsoil removal with bulldozers
4. Overburden (non-ore rock) stripped using dragline excavators
5. Bauxite layer exposed at 4-6 meters depth
6. Hydraulic excavators dig bauxite ore from pit floor
7. Ore loaded into 200-ton capacity haul trucks
8. Transport to primary crushing station at pit edge
9. Jaw crushers reduce ore to <150mm fragments
10. Conveyors move crushed ore to screening station
11. Vibrating screens separate ore by size (0-30mm, 30-80mm, 80-150mm)
12. Oversized material returned to crusher for reprocessing
13. Clay content tested in field laboratory (target <15%)
14. Moisture content measured (typically 8-12%)
15. Iron oxide content analyzed (preferably <20%)
16. Silica content checked (lower is better for alumina extraction)
17. Acceptable ore stockpiled by grade (high, medium, low)
18. Blending of different grades to achieve consistent feed
19. Water spraying for dust suppression during handling
20. Beneficiation washing removes excess clay and silica
21. Log washers scrub ore in high-speed rotating drums
22. Classifier tanks separate heavy bauxite from light impurities
23. Thickeners recover water for recycling
24. Dewatered ore contains 35-45% aluminum oxide
25. Quality control sampling every 2 hours
26. XRF analysis confirms chemical composition
27. Ore stockpiled in 50,000-ton capacity yards
28. Front-end loaders reclaim ore for shipment
29. Conveyors transport to rail loading facility
30.  100-car trains carry ore to port (10,000 tons per train)
31. Ship loading via conveyor and boom system
32.  80,000-ton bulk carriers transport to alumina refineries
33. Pit rehabilitation begins in depleted areas
34. Topsoil replaced and native vegetation planted
35. Water management prevents acid mine drainage
36. Continuous monitoring of groundwater quality
37. Safety inspections of pit walls for stability
38. Equipment maintenance in dedicated workshop
39. Workforce training on mining safety procedures
40. Production target: 15-30 million tons per year per mine
