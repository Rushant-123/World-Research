# How to Make EUV Lithography Machine

**Market Leader:** [ASML](/companies/asml) (100% market share)


Most complex machine humans have ever built. ASML Twinscan NXE:3800 costs $200 million, weighs 180 tons. Uses 13.5nm wavelength extreme ultraviolet light to pattern sub-7nm features on silicon wafers. Enables cutting-edge chips (M3, latest GPUs, advanced AI processors).

## Key Components:
[EUV Source](euv-source): Tin droplets hit by laser, create 13.5nm light plasma. [Multilayer Mirrors](mo-si-mirrors): 40-80 alternating layers of molybdenum/silicon reflect EUV (normal mirrors absorb it). [Vacuum Chamber](ultra-high-vacuum): 10⁻⁶ Pa - EUV absorbed by air. [Precision Stages](precision-stage): Position wafer/mask to 0.5nm accuracy. Assembly takes 12-18 months. Only ASML makes EUV machines. Production: ~50 units/year. Each machine contains 100,000+ parts from 5,000+ suppliers across 50+ countries.

Required for <7nm node semiconductors. Without EUV: no modern smartphones, no M3 chips, no AI accelerators.
