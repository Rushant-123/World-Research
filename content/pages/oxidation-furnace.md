# How to Make Oxidation Furnace

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Tokyo Electron](/companies/tokyo-electron)
- [Kokusai Electric](/companies/kokusai-electric)



Grows silicon dioxide (SiO₂) layer on silicon wafer by heating in oxygen ambient. SiO₂ is gate oxide (insulates transistor gate) and isolation layer. Temperature: 800-1200°C. Thickness: 1-500nm.

## Types:
**Dry oxidation:** Pure O₂. Slow, dense, high quality. Si + O₂ → SiO₂. Rate: 10-50 nm/hour at 1000°C.
**Wet oxidation:** O₂ + H₂O (steam). Faster, less dense. Si + 2H₂O → SiO₂ + 2H₂. Rate: 100-300 nm/hour.

[Quartz Tube](fused-quartz-tube) (99.99% SiO₂, 150mm diameter, 2m long). [Heating Elements](heating-coils) (resistance heaters) create 3-zone temperature profile. [Gas System](oxygen-delivery) delivers ultra-pure oxygen. [Wafer Boats](quartz-boat) hold 25-150 wafers vertically. Cost: $3-6 million. Batch process: 1-4 hours per run.
