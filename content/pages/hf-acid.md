Most dangerous acid in electronics manufacturing. Only chemical that etches silicon dioxide. Used in semiconductor wafer cleaning, glass etching, metal surface treatment. Extremely hazardous - penetrates skin without pain, causes deep tissue and bone damage. Fatality risk from skin contact with concentrated solutions.

**Step 1-5: [Fluorspar](fluorspar-mineral) Preparation**
Mine fluorspar ore (calcium fluoride, CaF₂) containing 60-98% CaF₂. Crush to 10-50mm pieces using jaw crusher. Grind to 100-200 mesh powder in ball mill. Remove impurities by flotation - add collectors (oleic acid), pump air through slurry. CaF₂ floats, gangue sinks. Filter and dry at 150°C for 6 hours. Typical fluorspar: 97% CaF₂, 2% SiO₂, 1% CaCO₃. Store in dry hopper.

**Step 6-15: Reaction Setup in [Steel Vessel](steel-vessel)**
Install reaction vessel made from carbon steel lined with [PTFE (Teflon)](teflon-coating) or lead. HF corrodes glass, most metals, concrete - only PTFE, polyethylene, lead, platinum resist. Vessel capacity: 5,000-20,000 liters. Install heating jacket around vessel connected to steam supply at 3-5 bar. Mount mechanical stirrer with PTFE-coated blades. Install temperature sensors (thermocouple) at 3 heights. Connect to automated control system. Install pressure relief valve rated for 2 bar. Connect exhaust to scrubber system (sodium hydroxide solution to neutralize HF vapors). Wear full protective equipment: acid-resistant suit, face shield, neoprene gloves (double layer), respirator with HF cartridge. Keep calcium gluconate gel nearby (antidote for HF burns).

**Step 16-25: Chemical Reaction**
Charge 1,000 kg fluorspar powder into reaction vessel through top port. Add 980 kg concentrated [sulfuric acid](sulfuric-acid) (93-98% H₂SO₄) slowly over 30 minutes - exothermic reaction begins immediately. Reaction: CaF₂ + H₂SO₄ → 2HF + CaSO₄. Calcium sulfate (gypsum) precipitates as solid. Heat vessel to 200-250°C using steam jacket. At 200°C, HF begins to volatilize (boiling point: 19.5°C at 1 atm). Maintain temperature at 220°C for 4-6 hours. Stir at 30 rpm continuously to prevent caking of CaSO₄. Monitor pressure (should stay below 1.5 bar). HF vapors exit through top outlet. Yield: ~400 kg anhydrous HF gas from 1,000 kg fluorspar (theoretical 490 kg, actual 81% yield).

**Step 26-35: Distillation and Purification**
Direct HF vapors into [distillation column](chemical-distillation) (PTFE or nickel construction). Column has 10-15 theoretical plates. Feed enters at middle stage. Bottom temperature: 112°C. Top temperature: 19°C. Reflux ratio: 3:1. Impurities (SO₂, SiF₄, water) separate by boiling point. SiF₄ (bp -86°C) exits as overhead vapor, sent to scrubber. HF (bp 19.5°C) condenses in middle section. H₂SO₄ mist and H₂O stay in bottom, returned to reactor. Collect purified anhydrous HF (>99.9%) in polyethylene receiver cooled to 5°C. Flow rate: 50-100 kg/hour. Continuous distillation for 8-12 hours per batch.

**Step 36-45: Dilution (for aqueous HF)**
Most semiconductor applications use 1-49% aqueous HF, not anhydrous. Dilute carefully - NEVER add water to concentrated HF (violent reaction). Always add HF to water. In polyethylene mixing tank, charge 800 liters [ultra-pure water](ultra-pure-water) (18 MΩ·cm). Cool to 5°C with chiller. Add anhydrous HF slowly through dip tube submerged in water. Add 200 kg HF over 2 hours while stirring at 100 rpm. Temperature rises to 30-40°C (exothermic). Cool back to 20°C. Result: 49% HF solution (typical etch grade). For lower concentrations, add more water. 1% HF: dilute 1:50. 10% HF: dilute 1:5. Measure concentration by titration with NaOH.

**Step 46-55: Quality Control**
Test purity by GC-MS (gas chromatography). Semiconductor-grade HF: metals <1 ppb (parts per billion). Test for specific contaminants: Na, K, Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr (each <0.1 ppb). Test for particles: <10 particles/mL >0.1µm. Use cleanroom filtration (0.02µm PTFE filters) to remove particles. Test silica content (from SiO₂ impurity in fluorspar): <1 ppm for electronic grade. Adjust by re-distillation if needed. Check for sulfate ions (from H₂SO₄ carryover): <5 ppm. Verify pH of 49% solution: <1. Store samples from each batch for 2 years for traceability.

**Step 56-65: Packaging and [Storage](plastic-tanks)**
Package in polyethylene or PTFE containers. Glass cannot be used (HF etches glass). For small volumes: 1-5 liter HDPE bottles with screw cap. For bulk: 50-200 liter carboys or 1000 liter totes. Purge container headspace with dry nitrogen (prevents water absorption from air). Label with concentration, batch number, production date, hazard warnings. Store in ventilated chemical storage area at 15-25°C. Separate from bases, oxidizers, water-reactive materials. Maximum storage time: 1 year (slow etching of plastic containers releases particles over time). Inspect containers monthly for leaks or degradation.

**Step 66-75: [Safety Equipment](chemical-safety) and Handling**
Maintain safety shower and eyewash station within 10 meters of handling area. Test weekly. Keep calcium gluconate gel (2.5%) in first-aid kit - apply immediately to any skin contact. Stock calcium gluconate IV solution for medical treatment. Install HF gas detectors at 3 ppm alarm level (PEL: 3 ppm TWA). Wear personal protective equipment: neoprene gloves (not latex or nitrile - HF penetrates), face shield, acid-resistant apron, rubber boots. For spills: evacuate area, wear SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus), neutralize with soda ash (sodium carbonate) or lime (calcium hydroxide). Dispose of neutralized waste as hazardous material. Train all personnel on HF emergency response annually.

**Step 76-85: Application Methods**
For oxide etching: dilute to 1-10% HF. Immerse silicon wafer in PTFE tank. Etch rate: 100-1000 Å/min depending on concentration and temperature. Room temperature typically sufficient. Rinse in cascading DI water (5 tanks) after etch. For BOE (Buffered Oxide Etch): mix 7:1 NH₄F:HF. Buffer slows etch rate, improves uniformity. Used for thin oxide removal. For BHF (Buffered HF): 40% NH₄F, 49% HF, ratio varies 10:1 to 6:1. Etch rate: 50-200 Å/min. Selective to oxide over silicon (100:1 selectivity).

**Step 86-95: Waste Treatment**
Collect spent HF solutions containing dissolved silica and metals. Cannot discharge to drain (environmental hazard). Neutralize with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime): 2HF + Ca(OH)₂ → CaF₂ + 2H₂O. Add lime slowly - exothermic. Heat evolved: 150 kJ/mol. Monitor pH, target 7-8. CaF₂ precipitates as sludge. Add flocculant (polyacrylamide) to aid settling. Let settle for 4 hours. Decant supernatant water (test for residual fluoride <10 ppm). Filter sludge on belt press. Dispose of CaF₂ cake as hazardous waste (contains co-precipitated heavy metals). Alternative: regenerate HF by treating CaF₂ with H₂SO₄ (reverse of production reaction) - closes loop.

**Hazards:** Acute toxicity. Skin contact: deep tissue burns, bone dissolution. Inhalation: pulmonary edema, death. Systemic effects: hypocalcemia, cardiac arrhythmia. Chronic exposure: fluorosis (skeletal changes). Spill releases HF vapors (bp 19.5°C) which are heavier than air, accumulate in low areas. Glass containers explode due to HF corrosion. Price: $2-10/kg depending on purity and concentration. Semiconductor-grade (electronic grade): $5-10/kg. Industrial grade: $2-5/kg. Transportation: Class 8 corrosive, Class 6.1 toxic.
