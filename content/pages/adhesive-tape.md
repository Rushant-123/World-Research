# How to Make Double-Sided Adhesive Tape

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Nitto Denko](/companies/nitto-denko)
- [Tesa](/companies/tesa)



A pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) tape with adhesive coated on both sides of a thin carrier film or foam. Used in electronics assembly to bond components: batteries, displays, heatsinks, EMI shields. Provides instant bonding without curing time. Acrylic adhesive formulation offers high temperature resistance, UV stability, and clean removal. Thickness: 0.05-0.5mm depending on application.

## What is it?

A thin flexible tape consisting of a carrier substrate (polyester film, foam, or tissue) with acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive coated on both faces. Protected by silicone-coated release liners until use. Adhesive properties: tack (immediate stick), peel strength (resistance to removal), shear strength (resistance to sliding). High-performance tapes withstand 150°C for battery bonding. Foam tapes provide cushioning and gap-filling. VHB (Very High Bond) tapes can replace screws and rivets. Die-cut into custom shapes for automated assembly.

## Steps to Make:
