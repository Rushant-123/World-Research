- [Qualcomm](/companies/qualcomm)



A wireless network card combining Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11ax/Wi-Fi 6E) and Bluetooth 5.3 on single module. Provides wireless connectivity for internet and peripheral devices. Modern MacBooks use integrated Wi-Fi 6E supporting 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands with speeds up to 2.4 Gbps.

## What is it?

M.2 form factor wireless card (22mm × 30mm) with integrated RF transceiver chip, power amplifiers, LNAs (low-noise amplifiers), antenna connectors, and MAC/baseband processor. Supports: Wi-Fi 6/6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3, MIMO (multiple antennas), beamforming, MU-MIMO. Connects to logic board via M.2 PCIe interface.

## Steps to Make (see inputs for detailed manufacturing)

This page serves as an integration point. Full manufacturing details for complex ICs like the RF chip would require 100+ steps covering semiconductor fabrication. The key is that this card integrates multiple complex components onto a small PCB with careful RF design.
