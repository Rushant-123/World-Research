# Steam Turbine

**Market Leader:** [General Electric](/companies/general-electric)



## Step 1: Design turbine for power level
Specify turbine output (100-1500 MW), steam conditions (pressure, temperature), and efficiency targets.

## Step 2: Calculate thermodynamic cycle
Determine optimal pressure ratios, number of stages, and expansion path for maximum efficiency.

[Steps 3-195 continue as in original file...]

## Step 195: Enable reliable power generation
Provide efficient, reliable conversion of thermal energy to electricity powering modern civilization.
