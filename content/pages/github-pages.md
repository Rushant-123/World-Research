# How to Make GitHub Pages Hosting

**Market Leader:** [GitHub (Microsoft)](/companies/github-microsoft)



GitHub Pages is a free static website hosting service integrated with GitHub repositories. Serves HTML/CSS/JS files directly from repository. Supports custom domains and HTTPS. Built on Fastly CDN for global distribution.

## What is it?

Free web hosting for static sites stored in GitHub repositories. Automatically rebuilds and deploys when you push changes. Uses [GitHub Infrastructure](github) for storage, [Web Servers](nginx-servers) (Nginx) for serving, [Fastly CDN](fastly-cdn) for content delivery, and [Let's Encrypt](lets-encrypt) for free HTTPS certificates. 1GB storage limit, 100GB bandwidth/month, globally distributed.

## How to Use:
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Add HTML/CSS/JS files or use Jekyll/Hugo to generate them
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Select source branch (usually main or gh-pages)
5. GitHub automatically builds and deploys
6. Site accessible at username.github.io/repository
7. Optional: configure custom domain (CNAME record)
8. GitHub provisions SSL certificate automatically
9. CDN distributes content globally for fast loading
10. Free for public repositories

**Benefits:** Zero cost, automatic deployment, HTTPS included, version controlled, integrated with GitHub workflow.
