## Quality Control Standards

Cut edge quality verification ensures clean separation without ragged tears or material deformation. Cutting edge inspection examines rule sharpness and condition using 10x magnification. Dimensional accuracy testing measures cut blank dimensions against specifications with 0.5mm tolerance. Creasing quality evaluation checks fold formation without material cracking or fiber damage. Perforation testing verifies easy manual separation along perforation path. Die flatness measurement uses precision straightedge checking for warping beyond 0.5mm. Rule height uniformity testing measures protrusion at multiple points verifying consistency within 0.1mm. Rubber compression testing evaluates ejection strip resilience and material release performance. Production consistency monitoring samples blanks throughout run checking dimensional stability. Counter-plate wear inspection examines opposing surface for damage from excessive cutting pressure.

Die service life typically reaches 250,000-500,000 impressions before requiring sharpening or replacement.

## Environmental Controls

Workshop conditions maintain 20-24 degrees Celsius temperature with 40-60% relative humidity preventing plywood dimensional changes. Dust collection systems capture wood particles during laser cutting and paper dust during die operation. Ventilation systems exhaust laser cutting fumes removing combustion products from operator breathing zone. Compressed air filtration removes moisture and particulates preventing contamination of pneumatic press systems. Noise control measures include press enclosures and hearing protection for operators during production. Material storage areas maintain climate control preventing moisture absorption that affects cutting performance. Adhesive storage follows temperature specifications ensuring proper viscosity and curing characteristics. Waste segregation separates wood scraps, metal rule pieces, and rubber materials for appropriate recycling. Press lubrication uses biodegradable oils minimizing environmental impact of maintenance fluids. Energy monitoring tracks power consumption during laser cutting and press operations optimizing production efficiency.
