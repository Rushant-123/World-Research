1. Coal seam identified through exploration drilling
2. Overburden thickness measured (typically 30-100 meters)
3. Strip mining economical when stripping ratio <30:1
4. Site preparation clears vegetation
5. Topsoil removed and stockpiled separately
6. First cut exposes coal seam
7. Dragline excavator removes overburden
8. Bucket capacity: 50-100 cubic meters
9. Overburden cast into adjacent mined-out strip
10. Coal seam exposed in long parallel strips
11. Coal thickness typically 1-10 meters
12. Bulldozers push coal into windrows
13. Front-end loaders load coal into trucks
14. Trucks transport to preparation plant
15. Sequential strips mined advancing across property
16. Highwall created at excavation face
17. Final highwall angle designed for stability (30-45°)
18. Spoil pile created from overburden
19. Grading of spoil to approximate original contour
20. Replacement of topsoil on graded spoil
21. Seeding with native grasses and legumes
22. Tree planting in reclaimed areas
23. Erosion control structures installed
24. Sediment ponds capture runoff
25. Water quality monitoring downstream
26. Groundwater monitoring wells
27. Concurrent reclamation behind mining operation
28. Reclamation bond held by regulatory authority
29. Final inspection before bond release
30. Post-mining land use established (pasture, forest, wildlife)
