1. Bastnäsite is a fluoro-carbonate mineral of rare earths
2. Formula: (Ce,La)(CO3)F
3. Typical grade: 5-10% rare earth oxides (REO)
4. Open pit mining method
5. Overburden removal with draglines
6. Ore drilling and blasting
7. Loading with hydraulic shovels
8. Hauling in 240-ton trucks
9. Primary crushing to <300mm
10. Conveyor transport to processing plant
11. Secondary and tertiary crushing to <10mm
12. Grinding in rod and ball mills
13. Target size: 80% < 150 microns
14. Flotation separates bastnäsite from gangue
15. Collectors: hydroxamic acids or fatty acids
16. pH control at 8-10
17. Bastnäsite concentrate: 60% REO
18. Concentrate contains Ce, La, Pr, Nd, Sm
19. Thickening and filtration
20. Roasting at 600-800°C to convert carbonates
21. Acid leaching with HCl or H2SO4
22. Rare earths dissolve as chlorides or sulfates
23. Solvent extraction separates individual elements
24. Extraction stages: 50-100 mixer-settlers
25. Cerium separated first (oxidizes to Ce4+)
26. Lanthanum extracted next
27. Light rare earths (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) separated
28. Individual element purity: 99-99.9%
29. Oxalate precipitation
30. Calcination produces rare earth oxides
31. REO purity: 99.5-99.99%
32. Packaging in drums or supersacks
33. Environmental: tailings neutralization
34. Radioactive elements (thorium, uranium) managed
35. Tailings storage facility engineered
36. Production: 20,000-50,000 tons REO per year
37. Mine life: 20-50 years
38. Rare earths critical for magnets, catalysts, phosphors
