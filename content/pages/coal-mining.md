# How to Make Coal Mining Operations

Coal mining extracts coal from underground seams or surface deposits for use in power generation (60% globally), steelmaking (15%), cement production (8%), and industrial processes (17%). Two primary methods: surface mining (open-pit, strip mining) for shallow deposits <150m depth, and underground mining (room-and-pillar, longwall) for deeper seams 150-1,500m depth. Global production: 8.5 billion tonnes/year (2025), dominated by China (50%), India (12%), Indonesia (9%), USA (7%), Australia (7%). Coal reserves: 1.1 trillion tonnes, 130-year supply at current rates. Industry declining in developed nations due to climate concerns, but growing in Asia.

## What is it?

Industrial-scale extraction of coal (sedimentary rock, 60-95% carbon content) from geological deposits formed 300-50 million years ago. Modern operations use massive equipment: draglines (14,000 tonnes, 100m boom), continuous miners (cutting 5 tonnes/min), longwall shearers (300m wide cutting face), haul trucks (400 tonne capacity). Production scale: small mines 100K tonnes/year to mega-mines 100 million tonnes/year (North Antelope Rochelle, Wyoming). Employment: 7 million miners globally. Environmental footprint: habitat destruction, water contamination, methane emissions (50-200 Mt CO₂e/year), coal ash waste (1.5 Gt/year). Processing required: crush, wash, separate coal from rock, reduce ash content from 25% to 8-15%.

## Steps to Make:

**Step 1-20: Geological Exploration and Resource Assessment**

1. Coal formation: plant matter accumulation in ancient swamps (Carboniferous period 300 Mya) → burial by sediments → heat + pressure → coalification over millions of years
2. Coal rank progression: peat (precursor, 50-60% C) → lignite (brown coal, 60-70% C) → sub-bituminous (70-80% C) → bituminous (80-90% C) → anthracite (90-95% C, hardest)
3. Exploration phase: identify coal-bearing formations through geological surveys, satellite imagery, historical mining records
4. Surface mapping: locate coal outcrop exposures in eroded valleys, stream cuts, road cuts
5. Geophysical surveys: seismic reflection (sound waves map subsurface layers), resistivity (electrical conductivity differentiates coal from shale)
6. Core drilling: rotary drill rigs bore 50-500m deep holes, extract 50-75mm diameter rock cores
7. Core logging: geologist examines cores, measures coal seam thickness, notes ash layers, records depth
8. Typical seam thickness: 0.5-30m (thin <1m marginal, thick >5m economical, Powder River Basin Wyoming has 20-70m seams)
9. Sample analysis: proximate analysis determines moisture (5-40%), ash (5-30%), volatile matter (15-45%), fixed carbon (40-80%)
10. Ultimate analysis: measures carbon (60-95%), hydrogen (3-6%), oxygen (2-20%), nitrogen (1-2%), sulfur (0.3-5%)
11. Heating value: energy content 10-35 MJ/kg (lignite 10-20, sub-bituminous 18-25, bituminous 24-35 MJ/kg)
12. Sulfur content critical: low-sulfur <1% commands premium, high-sulfur >2% requires expensive scrubbers at power plants
13. Drilling density: 200-500m spacing for initial assessment, 50-100m for detailed reserve calculation
14. 3D geological model: software (Maptek, Datamine, Micromine) interpolates between drill holes, models seam geometry
15. Reserve calculation: proven reserves (high confidence, <500m drill spacing), probable reserves (moderate confidence), inferred (low confidence)
16. Economic cutoff: minimum seam thickness (surface 0.5m, underground 0.8m), maximum ash content (35%), maximum depth (surface <150m, underground <1,500m)
17. Strip ratio: overburden thickness / coal thickness, surface mining economical if <20:1
18. Resource vs. reserve: resource = coal in ground (10+ trillion tonnes), reserve = economically recoverable (1.1 trillion tonnes)
19. Pre-feasibility study: estimate resources, preliminary mine design, capex/opex estimates, $500K-2M cost
20. Feasibility study: detailed engineering, financial model, environmental baseline, $5M-20M, 1-2 years

**Step 21-45: Surface Mining - Overburden Removal**

21. Surface mining method selected when coal seam <100-150m deep, strip ratio <15-20:1
22. Pre-mining: clear vegetation, topsoil removal (0.5-2m depth), stockpile separately for reclamation
23. Overburden: rock, soil, shale, sandstone layers above coal seam (5-100m thickness)
24. **Drill and blast**: first step to fragment overburden rock
25. Rotary blast-hole drills: 310-450mm diameter holes, 10-30m depth, grid pattern 6-10m spacing
26. Explosive: ANFO (Ammonium Nitrate + Fuel Oil, 94/6 ratio), cheapest explosive $0.50-1/kg
27. Loading: pneumatic truck pumps ANFO into blast holes, 200-500 kg per hole
28. Stemming: fill top 2-3m of hole with crushed rock or drill cuttings (confines explosion downward)
29. Initiation: electric detonators or non-electric shock tube, millisecond-delay timing (25-100ms between holes)
30. Blast pattern: rows fire sequentially, creates fragmentation and throws rock forward
31. Blast yield: 0.3-0.6 kg explosive per cubic meter overburden, breaks rock into 0.2-1m fragments
32. **Dragline excavation**: most common for thick overburden (20-100m)
33. Dragline: massive walking excavator, bucket suspended from boom by cables
34. Largest draglines: Big Muskie (13,500 tonnes, 150m boom, demolished 1999), Bagger 293 Germany (14,200 tonnes, bucket-wheel not dragline)
35. Modern draglines: 100-200m boom length, 40-170 m³ bucket capacity, 2,000-14,000 tonne machine weight
36. Operation: cast bucket 100m, drag across overburden filling bucket, swing 90-180°, dump into spoil pile
37. Spoil pile: overburden deposited in previously mined area, creates backfill
38. Productivity: 100,000-300,000 bank cubic meters per month (1-3 million tonnes overburden)
39. Crew: 1 operator per shift (3 shifts/day), maintenance crew 5-10 mechanics
40. **Truck-and-shovel method**: alternative to dragline, more flexible
41. Hydraulic shovel or electric rope shovel: 30-80 m³ bucket, loads in 3-5 passes
42. Haul trucks: ultra-class 300-400 tonne capacity (Caterpillar 797F, Komatsu 980E-4)
43. Haul distance: 0.5-5 km to spoil dump or backfill area
44. Productivity: shovel loads 2,000-4,000 tonnes/hour, fleet of 6-12 trucks per shovel
45. Advantages: handles variable overburden thickness, harder rock, selective mining

**Step 46-70: Surface Mining - Coal Extraction and Hauling**

46. Coal seam exposed: remove final layer of rock carefully, avoid dilution (mixing coal with rock)
47. Free-digging: some coal soft enough to load without blasting (Powder River Basin sub-bituminous)
48. Coal blasting (if needed): lighter charges than overburden, 0.1-0.3 kg/m³, preserve size
49. **Loading equipment**: front-end loaders (10-30 m³ bucket) or smaller shovels (10-20 m³)
50. Separate fleet from overburden equipment: prevents cross-contamination, maintains coal quality
51. Load directly into haul trucks: 150-250 tonne coal-only trucks (smaller than overburden trucks)
52. Quality control: avoid mining floor rock (0.5-1m above seam floor), avoid roof rock (0.3-0.5m below next layer)
53. Dilution target: <5% rock in raw coal (increases ash, reduces heating value)
54. In-pit crushing (some mines): primary crusher in pit, reduce size to <300mm, transport via conveyor
55. **Conveyor systems**: long-distance transport, economical for large mines
56. Belt conveyors: 1.5-2.5m wide belts, 5-10 m/s speed, 2,000-8,000 tonnes/hour capacity
57. Overland conveyors: 5-15 km long, multiple transfer points, lower cost than trucks ($0.01-0.03/tonne·km vs. $0.10-0.30)
58. Haul trucks (if no conveyor): 1-10 km to processing plant or rail loadout
59. Haul roads: maintained graded surface, 30-50 km/hour truck speed, water trucks suppress dust
60. Truck cycle time: load 3-5 min, haul 10-30 min, dump 2 min, return 10-30 min = 25-65 min total
61. Fleet management: GPS tracking, dispatch system optimizes truck allocation (Modular, Wenco, CAT MineStar)
62. Fuel consumption: haul trucks 100-200 L/hour diesel, $150-300/hour fuel cost at $1.50/L
63. Tire costs: $40K-80K per tire, 6-12 tires per truck, 6,000-8,000 hour life
64. Maintenance: 250-hour service (oil change, filters), 500-hour (inspections), 2,000-hour (major overhaul)
65. Production rate: large surface mine 10-50 million tonnes/year coal (100K-200K tonnes/day)
66. Shift schedule: 2-3 shifts/day, 12-hour shifts common, continuous operation 24/7 (except maintenance, blasting)
67. Manning: 50-200 operators/mechanics per mine (dragline 3, shovels 15, trucks 40, dozers 10, support 30)
68. Safety: high-visibility clothing, rollover protection (ROPS/FOPS cabs), collision avoidance radar, speed limiters
69. Environmental controls: dust suppression (water sprays, chemical binders), noise barriers, berms block visual impact
70. Rehabilitation: concurrent reclamation, backfill mined areas, contour to original topography, replace topsoil, revegetate

**Step 71-95: Underground Mining - Room-and-Pillar Method**

71. Underground mining: coal seam >100-150m deep or steep terrain where surface mining impractical
72. Access: vertical shaft (200-1,200m deep, 4-8m diameter) or decline (sloped tunnel 1:10 to 1:7 grade)
73. Shaft sinking: drill-and-blast or raise boring, 10-30m/month progress, $5K-15K per meter, 1-3 years
74. Shaft lining: concrete or steel sets, waterproofing, dewatering pumps (1-10 ML/day if wet)
75. **Room-and-pillar mining**: most common underground method (40% of underground production)
76. Mine layout: drive entries (tunnels) in grid pattern, leave pillars (coal columns) to support roof
77. Entry dimensions: 5-7m wide, 2-4m tall (seam height), advance 100-500m from shaft
78. Pillar dimensions: 15-30m × 15-30m square or rectangular, spacing 30-50m center-to-center
79. Pillar design: geotechnical analysis, ensure safety factor 1.5-2.0 (pillar strength / overburden load)
80. Extraction ratio: 40-60% of coal removed (remainder left as pillars for roof support)
81. **Continuous miner**: primary cutting machine, electric-powered (400-800 kW)
82. Cutting head: rotating drum 3-4m wide, 100-200 tungsten carbide picks (bits)
83. Cutting rate: 3-5 tonnes/min, advance 5-15m/shift
84. Loading: gathering arms sweep cut coal onto conveyor, transfer to shuttle car or continuous conveyor
85. Shuttle car: battery or diesel powered, 10-20 tonne capacity, hauls coal to belt feeder
86. Roof bolting: continuous miner cuts, roof bolter follows, installs rock bolts
87. Rock bolts: steel rods 1.5-3m long, 19-25mm diameter, resin or mechanical anchors
88. Bolt pattern: 1-1.5m spacing, 8-12 bolts per 6m of advance, suspend roof to stable strata above
89. Screen or mesh: steel or synthetic fiber, catch loose rock between bolts, prevent falls
90. Ventilation: critical for safety, force fresh air through entries, exhaust stale air
91. Main fans: surface-mounted, 500-5,000 kW, 100-1,000 m³/s airflow
92. Air velocity: 0.5-2 m/s in entries (minimum 0.3 m/s code requirement), 1-3 m/s at face
93. Methane control: coal seams release CH₄ gas (5-25 m³ per tonne coal mined), explosive at 5-15% concentration
94. Methane monitoring: continuous sensors at face, automatic shutdowns if >1% CH₄, evacuate if >1.5%
95. Retreat mining: after advancing to panel boundary, retreat and extract pillars (increases recovery to 60-75%, controlled roof collapse)

**Step 96-120: Underground Mining - Longwall Method**

96. **Longwall mining**: highly productive continuous method (60% of underground production)
97. Panel dimensions: 150-300m wide × 1,000-4,000m long, extract entire panel (no pillars within panel)
98. Development: drive two parallel entries (gateroads) along panel edges, 150-300m apart
99. Install equipment: assemble longwall face between gateroads (2-4 weeks equipment installation)
100. **Longwall shearer**: main cutting machine, travels along face on armored face conveyor (AFC)
101. Shearer specifications: 400-700 kW electric motors (two drums), 1.5-2.5m diameter cutting drums
102. Cutting drums: 100-150 picks per drum, helical arrangement, cuts top-to-bottom or vice-versa
103. Shearer passes: bi-directional, cuts web (0.8-1.2m depth) each pass, 3-10m advance per day
104. Production rate: 3,000-10,000 tonnes/day from single longwall face (1-3 Mt/year per panel)
105. **Powered roof supports**: hydraulic shields, move forward after each shearer pass
106. Shield count: 100-175 units along face, each 1.5m wide (covers 150-300m face length)
107. Shield design: canopy (roof contact), hydraulic legs (set pressure 400-800 tonnes), advancing mechanism
108. Set pressure: 5-8 bar hydraulic, resist overburden weight (200-1,000m depth, 5-25 MPa stress)
109. Shield cycle: (1) shearer cuts coal, (2) AFC advances 0.8-1.2m, (3) shields advance sequentially, (4) roof behind shields collapses (controlled caving)
110. Controlled caving: planned roof collapse fills mined-out area (goaf), gradual surface subsidence 0.5-3m
111. **Armored face conveyor (AFC)**: 150-300m long, runs along entire face
112. AFC: steel pans 1.5m long × 1m wide, chain-driven (twin chains 30-50mm), 1,000-2,000 tonne capacity/hour
113. Shearer rides on AFC rails, coal drops onto AFC as cut, conveyed to stage loader
114. **Stage loader (beam stage loader)**: transfer coal from AFC to belt conveyor
115. Belt conveyors: transport coal 2-8 km from face to shaft/slope, 1-1.5m wide belts, 800-2,000 tph
116. Ventilation: exhaust air flows along face (intake gateroad → face → return gateroad), dilute methane
117. Methane drainage: pre-drainage boreholes drilled into seam ahead of mining (30-80% gas removed before mining)
118. CMM (coal mine methane): captured CH₄ 95-98% purity, used for power generation (gas engines 1-20 MW)
119. Advantages: high recovery 70-90%, mechanized (safer, fewer workers underground), economies of scale
120. Disadvantages: high capex $200-800M (shearer $15-30M, shields $300-500K each, conveyors $50-150M, infrastructure), inflexible (commit to panel 1-3 years), surface subsidence

**Step 121-145: Coal Processing and Washing**

121. Raw coal (run-of-mine ROM): contaminated with rock, shale, clay, pyrite (FeS₂), 15-40% ash content
122. **Coal preparation plant** (wash plant): upgrade coal quality, reduce ash to 8-15% (thermal) or 7-10% (coking)
123. Throughput: 500-10,000 tonnes/hour, 5-50 Mt/year annual capacity
124. **Crushing**: primary crusher (jaw or roll) reduces ROM 500mm → 150mm
125. Screening: vibrating screens separate size fractions (+150mm, 150-50mm, 50-10mm, 10-1mm, -1mm)
126. Size-by-size treatment: each fraction processed separately (different methods for coarse vs. fine)
127. **Dense media separation (DMS)**: coarse coal (+50mm and 50-10mm fractions)
128. Heavy media: magnetite (Fe₃O₄) powder + water suspension, density 1.4-1.8 g/cm³
129. Density intermediate: coal 1.2-1.5 g/cm³ floats, rock 2.2-2.8 g/cm³ sinks
130. DMS bath or cyclone: coarse coal immersed in bath (static separator) or cyclone (centrifugal force enhances separation)
131. Residence time: 15-30 seconds, coal floats to surface, rock sinks to bottom
132. Product streams: clean coal (low-ash product), middlings (intermediate density, reprocess or reject), reject (high-ash rock)
133. Drain and rinse: wash magnetite from coal and rock, screen to remove water
134. Magnetite recovery: magnetic separators (drum or belt), recover 98-99.5% magnetite, recycle to circuit
135. Magnetite makeup: 0.1-0.5 kg per tonne coal processed (losses from product moisture, spillage)
136. **Froth flotation**: fine coal (-10mm to -0.5mm particles)
137. Flotation cell: aerated tank, coal particles 0.05-10mm
138. Reagents: collector (diesel or kerosene 0.5-2 kg/t, makes coal hydrophobic), frother (MIBC 0.1-0.5 kg/t, stabilizes bubbles)
139. Air bubbles: injected or mechanically agitated, 0.5-3mm diameter
140. Coal attachment: hydrophobic coal adheres to bubbles, floats to surface (froth layer 10-30cm)
141. Froth overflow: skim froth (coal product), shale/clay sink (tailings)
142. Flotation stages: rougher (bulk separation), cleaner (upgrade froth), scavenger (recover losses from tailings)
143. **Dewatering**: remove water from clean coal (20-35% surface moisture after washing)
144. Screening: static or vibrating screens, drain free water, 20-30% moisture remains
145. Centrifuge: fine coal <1mm, spin at 1,000-3,000 rpm, 10-15% moisture product

**Step 146-170: Drying, Quality Control, and Storage**

146. **Thermal drying** (export coal or high-moisture coals): reduce moisture to 5-10%
147. Dryer types: fluidized bed (coal suspended in hot gas), rotary drum (tumbling in heated cylinder)
148. Heat source: natural gas burners or waste heat from power plant/coke oven
149. Temperature: 150-300°C gas inlet, 80-100°C exhaust, evaporate moisture without ignition
150. Energy consumption: 3,000-4,000 kJ per kg water evaporated (2.5-3.3 MJ/kg coal if reducing moisture 30% → 10%)
151. Cost: $5-15/tonne (fuel + capital), only economical for premium products or long-distance shipping
152. **Filter press**: ultra-fine coal -0.5mm, plate-and-frame press, 25-35% moisture (lower than centrifuge for finest sizes)
153. Thickener: gravity settling tank, separate fine coal slurry from water, 30-60m diameter, 200-1,000 tonnes/hour
154. Flocculants: polymers (polyacrylamide 10-50 g/tonne), agglomerate fine particles, accelerate settling
155. Tailings disposal: reject material 10-40% of ROM (high-ash rock, pyrite, ultra-fine slurry)
156. Tailings impoundment: dam retains slurry (water + fine refuse), 10-100 hectare footprint
157. Paste backfill: thickened tailings (60-70% solids) pumped underground, fill mined voids, reduce surface disposal
158. Dry stacking: filter tailings to 15-20% moisture, stack like soil, eliminates dam failure risk (but higher cost)
159. **Quality control**: continuous sampling and analysis
160. Sample every 1,000-5,000 tonnes: analyze ash, moisture, sulfur, heating value, size distribution
161. Blend coal: mix high-ash and low-ash to meet target specification (e.g., target 12% ash, blend 8% + 16%)
162. Automated sampling: mechanical samplers on conveyor belts, cross-belt cutters, composite sample every hour
163. XRF analyzer: X-ray fluorescence, real-time ash estimation (non-contact sensor on conveyor)
164. Washability curve: plot ash vs. yield at different separation densities, optimize media density
165. **Storage**: stockpile or silo
166. Stockpiles: open-air, conical piles 5-15m tall, 5,000-500,000 tonne capacity
167. Compaction: dozer compacts surface, reduces oxygen infiltration, prevents spontaneous combustion
168. Spontaneous combustion: coal oxidation exothermic, slow heating → ignition (weeks to months), risk for high-volatile coals
169. Prevention: compact stockpile, minimize storage time, temperature monitoring (thermal imaging or probes)
170. Silos/bunkers: enclosed, 500-5,000 tonne capacity, short-term surge storage, feed train/ship loadout

**Step 171-195: Transportation, Markets, and Economics**

171. **Rail transport**: dominant mode (60% of coal), unit trains to power plants or ports
172. Unit train: 100-150 railcars × 100 tonne/car = 10,000-15,000 tonne train
173. Rotary dump: railcar tippler, rotate cars 180° to dump coal (90 seconds/car), no manual unloading
174. Rail cost: $0.01-0.03/tonne·km (distance-dependent), e.g., Wyoming to Midwest 1,500 km = $15-45/tonne
175. **Seaborne export**: 1.2 billion tonnes/year international trade (15% of production)
176. Major exporters: Indonesia 450 Mt/year, Australia 380 Mt (200 Mt thermal + 180 Mt coking), Russia 200 Mt, USA 50 Mt, Colombia 60 Mt, South Africa 70 Mt
177. Major importers: China 300 Mt (supplements 4.2 Gt domestic), India 250 Mt, Japan 190 Mt, South Korea 130 Mt, Taiwan 70 Mt
178. Bulk carriers: Capesize (120,000-180,000 DWT, major routes Australia/Indonesia→China/India), Panamax (60,000-80,000 DWT)
179. Freight rates: $5-40/tonne (volatile, 2008 peak $140/tonne during boom, 2016 low $3/tonne oversupply)
180. Port infrastructure: shiploaders 10,000-16,000 tph, stockyards 5-20 Mt capacity, berths for 2-6 ships
181. Largest coal ports: Newcastle Australia (165 Mt/year), Gladstone Australia (85 Mt/year), Richards Bay South Africa (70 Mt/year), Rotterdam Europe (30 Mt import)
182. **Pricing**: thermal coal $50-200/tonne, coking coal $150-500/tonne
183. Benchmark prices: Newcastle 6,000 kcal/kg (thermal $80-150/tonne 2020-2024, spiked $400+ in 2022 energy crisis), Australia premium low-vol coking $200-350/tonne
184. **Production costs**: surface $20-60/tonne (Wyoming $15-25 lowest-cost, Australia $30-50), underground $40-120/tonne (longwall $50-80, room-pillar $60-100)
185. Cost components: mining (equipment, labor, fuel) 50-60%, processing 15-25%, transport 15-30%, overhead/administration 5-10%
186. Capital costs: surface mine $50-300M (dragline $30-100M, shovels/trucks $100-150M, infrastructure), underground $200-800M (shaft $100-200M, longwall $200-400M, ventilation/conveyors $100-200M)
187. Payback period: 3-8 years (depends on coal price, operating costs, reserve size)
188. Mine life: 10-50 years (depends on reserve size, production rate)
189. Employment: 50-500 workers per mine (surface 50-200, underground 200-500), plus contractors
190. Wages: $50K-100K/year (USA/Australia, varies by role: operator $60-90K, mechanic $70-100K, engineer $80-120K), lower in China/India $10-30K
191. Safety: underground fatalities 0.05-0.5 per Mt (USA/Australia ~0.01, China ~0.1, improving), surface safer 0.01-0.05 per Mt
192. Reclamation bonds: $5K-50K/hectare disturbed, post-mining land restoration (5-20 years monitoring)
193. Royalties: 5-15% of revenue (varies by country/region, federal/state/private land)
194. Taxes: corporate income tax, severance tax (production-based), property tax on equipment/land
195. Decline outlook: coal production peaked in OECD nations (USA 2008, Europe 1990s), growing in Asia until 2030, global peak projected 2025-2035, displacement by renewables (solar/wind cheaper, climate policy)

Coal mining deployed globally: 3,000+ major mines, production concentrated in China (50%), India (12%), Indonesia (9%), USA (7%), Australia (7%), Russia (6%). Uses: electricity generation 5.9 Gt/year (69%, declining in OECD but growing in Asia), steel production 1.3 Gt coking coal (15%, essential for blast furnaces), cement production 0.8 Gt (9%), residential/industrial 0.5 Gt (6%). Environmental challenges: CO₂ emissions (16 Gt/year from coal combustion, 40% of energy emissions), methane leakage (50-200 Mt CO₂e/year), water pollution (acid mine drainage, selenium), habitat destruction (surface mining). Industry undergoing transformation: phase-out in developed nations (Germany 2038, UK completed 2024, USA declining), continued growth in developing Asia through 2030s, long-term decline certain as renewables + storage undercut economics.
