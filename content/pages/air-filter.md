1. Design air filter specifications based on application requirements and airflow capacity

2. Select appropriate filter media type (HEPA, electrostatic, activated carbon, fiberglass)

3. Source filter media rolls in specified micron rating (0.3μm for HEPA, 5-10μm for standard)

4. Unroll filter media onto cutting table aligning to registration marks

5. Cut filter media to precise dimensions using rotary cutter or die-cut press

6. Pleat filter media using automated pleating machine creating uniform accordion folds

7. Set pleat spacing at 6-12 pleats per inch depending on filter grade

8. Apply adhesive beads along edges of pleated media using automated dispenser

9. Position steel or aluminum frame around pleated media pack

10. Press frame onto media pack creating hermetic seal between media and frame

11. Cure adhesive in convection oven at 80°C for 15 minutes

12. Install support grid on downstream side preventing media collapse under airflow

13. Apply gasket material to filter frame sealing surface

14. Die-cut or extrude closed-cell foam or rubber gasket in continuous strip

15. Adhere gasket to frame perimeter using pressure-sensitive adhesive

16. Inspect seal integrity checking for gaps or incomplete adhesion

17. Test filter efficiency using particle counter with challenge aerosol (DOP, NaCl)

18. Measure pressure drop across filter at rated airflow using manometer

19. Verify filter meets specified efficiency rating (MERV 8-16, or HEPA H13-H14)

20. Test structural integrity applying rated airflow and measuring deflection

21. Check gasket seal by pressurizing filter housing and measuring leak rate

22. Label filter with specifications (dimensions, MERV rating, max airflow, max pressure drop)

23. Apply date of manufacture and recommended replacement interval

24. Package filter in cardboard sleeve or plastic bag protecting from contamination

25. Palletize packaged filters securing with stretch wrap for warehouse storage

26. Store in climate-controlled warehouse preventing moisture absorption

27. Ship air filters to HVAC distributors, equipment manufacturers, and end users for installation in heating/cooling systems, clean rooms, paint booths, and industrial air handling equipment

28. Filters remove particulates, dust, pollen, and contaminants from air streams protecting equipment and ensuring air quality compliance with ASHRAE, ISO, and FDA clean room standards
