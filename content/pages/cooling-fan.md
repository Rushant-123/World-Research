# How to Make a Cooling Fan

**Top Market Leaders:**

A miniature axial fan (30-60mm diameter) using brushless DC motor to circulate air for laptop cooling. Moves 5-20 CFM (cubic feet per minute) at 2,000-6,000 RPM. Variable speed controlled by PWM (pulse width modulation) signal from system. Typical laptop has 1-2 fans.

## What is it?

Brushless DC (BLDC) motor with plastic impeller (fan blades) that draws cool air and expels hot air. Motor uses electronic commutation (no brushes) for reliability. Hall effect sensors detect rotor position. Controller IC drives motor coils in sequence. Fan speed varies based on CPU/GPU temperature. Fluid dynamic bearings or ball bearings for 50,000+ hour lifespan.

## Steps to Make (see inputs for detailed manufacturing)

Complex electromechanical device. Motor manufacturing alone requires 50+ steps. Key is precise balancing of impeller and smooth bearings for quiet operation at high RPM.
