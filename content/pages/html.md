# How to Make HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It was originally created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and is now maintained by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group).

## What is it?

A markup language that defines the structure and content of web pages using tags enclosed in angle brackets. HTML describes elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content. It's not a programming language - it's a way to structure and annotate content so web browsers know how to display it.

## Steps to Make:

1. Start with [Programming Language Design](language-design) principles for creating markup syntax
2. Define the core concepts: tags, attributes, elements, and document structure
3. Create a specification document defining all HTML tags and their behavior
4. Use a [Standards Committee](standards-body) (W3C/WHATWG) to review and approve the specification
5. Write the official specification with detailed rules for parsing and rendering
6. Define tags for document structure (html, head, body)
7. Define tags for content (p, h1-h6, div, span)
8. Define tags for media (img, video, audio)
9. Define tags for interactivity (a, button, form, input)
10. Specify how attributes work (class, id, src, href)
11. Create [Technical Documentation](technical-documentation) explaining how to use HTML
12. Build a [Web Browser](web-browser) that can parse HTML and render it visually
13. Test the browser with various HTML documents
14. Release the HTML specification as a free, open standard
15. Developers use a [Text Editor](text-editor) to write HTML code
16. Publish example HTML documents and tutorials
17. Update the specification over time (HTML5, HTML Living Standard)
18. Ensure backward compatibility with older HTML versions

The result is a free, open standard that anyone can use to create web pages. HTML files are plain text with .html extension that web browsers can read and display. No installation required - just knowledge of the tags and structure.
