1. Sour natural gas contains 1-5% hydrogen sulfide
2. Gas enters amine absorption unit at 40 bar pressure
3. Diethanolamine (DEA) solvent absorbs H2S selectively
4. Sweet gas exits for pipeline distribution
5. Rich amine heated to 120°C in regenerator
6. H2S gas released as amine is regenerated
7. Concentrated H2S stream sent to Claus plant
8. Thermal reactor burns one-third of H2S at 1,000°C
9. Reaction: 2H2S + 3O2 → 2SO2 + 2H2O
10. Hot gases cooled in waste heat boiler
11. Steam generation at 40 bar for plant use
12. Catalytic converters operate at 200-350°C
13. Alumina catalyst promotes Claus reaction
14. Reaction: 2H2S + SO2 → 3S + 2H2O
15. Liquid sulfur condenses at 155°C
16. First stage achieves 60% conversion to sulfur
17. Gases reheated for second catalytic stage
18. Second stage increases conversion to 92%
19. Third stage pushes conversion to 97%
20. Tail gas treatment recovers remaining sulfur
21. Overall sulfur recovery efficiency: 99.5%
22. Molten sulfur collected at 140°C
23. Sulfur degassing removes dissolved H2S
24. Purity achieved: 99.9% elemental sulfur
25. Liquid sulfur stored in heated tanks at 135°C
26. Solidification into prills using spray tower
27. Molten sulfur sprayed into cooling air
28. Prills (2-3mm diameter) form as droplets cool
29. Solid sulfur conveyed to storage
30. Alternative: sulfur cast into large blocks
31. Block sulfur formation in 1-ton molds
32. Quality testing for acidity (pH 6-8)
33. Ash content verified (<0.05%)
34. Sulfur shipped in bulk carriers or rail cars
35. Production rate: 10,000 tons per day from large gas plant
36. Continuous operation with automated process control
