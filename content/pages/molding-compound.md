## Final Packaging and Storage

The finished epoxy molding compound pellets are packaged in moisture-barrier bags with nitrogen atmosphere to prevent premature curing. Each bag is labeled with batch number, manufacturing date, and storage instructions. The compound is stored in a temperature-controlled warehouse at 5-15°C for optimal shelf life of 6-12 months. Prior to shipment, samples are tested to verify that material properties remain within specification. The molding compound is shipped to semiconductor packaging facilities worldwide where it is used to encapsulate integrated circuits, providing mechanical protection, electrical insulation, and environmental resistance throughout the device lifetime.
