# How to Make Heat Pipes

Passive thermal transfer devices using phase-change heat transfer (evaporation/condensation cycle). Copper heat pipes in MacBooks transport heat from CPU/GPU (hot end 70-100°C) to cooling fins/chassis (cold end 40-60°C), thermal conductivity 5,000-20,000 W/m·K effective (50-200× better than solid copper 400 W/m·K). Construction: sealed copper tube (3-8mm diameter, 100-200mm length), internal sintered copper wick (capillary structure), evacuated and charged with working fluid (water or methanol, 0.5-2 grams). Manufacturing involves wick sintering, tube assembly, evacuation, fluid charging, sealing, and flattening to fit laptop's thin profile (2-4mm final thickness).

**Step 1-12: Material Selection - [Copper Tubing](copper-tube) Preparation**
Receive seamless copper tubing (C12200 phosphorus-deoxidized, high-purity 99.9% Cu, 0.015-0.040% P). Phosphorus addition prevents hydrogen embrittlement, improves weldability. Tube specifications: Outer diameter 5-8mm (laptop heat pipes typically 6mm OD), wall thickness 0.3-0.5mm (thin walls maximize internal volume for vapor flow, but thick enough for structural integrity under vacuum, internal pressure cycling). Length: Cut to 120-250mm (depends on laptop size, thermal path distance from processor to cooling fins). Tube condition: Soft annealed (grain size 0.025-0.050mm, elongation >35%, enables bending and flattening without cracking). Surface: Clean bright copper, oxide-free (oxidation reduces thermal conductivity, contaminates working fluid). Inspection: Eddy current test verifies seamless construction (no welds or seams that could leak), pressure test 5-10 bar air confirms no pinhole leaks, dimensional check ±0.05mm on OD. Straightness: <0.5mm deviation per 100mm (bent tubes cause wick damage during insertion). Cleanliness critical: Degrease in alkaline cleaner (removes drawing lubricants), rinse with deionized water (DI water resistivity >1 MΩ·cm, no ionic contamination), pickle in 5-10% citric acid (removes surface oxides, brightens copper), final rinse DI water, dry in nitrogen atmosphere or vacuum oven 80-120°C × 30 min (eliminates moisture, moisture in sealed heat pipe generates non-condensable gas, degrades performance). Cost: $3.50-5.00/kg for copper tube, 6mm × 0.4mm × 150mm tube weighs 20 grams = $0.10 material.

**Step 13-35: Wick Structure - [Sintered Wick Material](copper-powder) Formation**
[Copper powder](copper-powder) for sintered wick: Electrolytic copper powder (99.5-99.9% purity), particle size 10-75 μm (controlled distribution, affects wick porosity and capillary pressure). Powder morphology: Dendritic or spherical (dendritic higher surface area, better sintering, spherical better packing density). **Wick design considerations**: Capillary wick transports liquid from condenser (cold end) back to evaporator (hot end) via capillary action (liquid pulled through microscopic pores by surface tension). Wick properties: Pore radius 5-50 μm (smaller pores = higher capillary pressure Pc = 2σ/r, where σ = surface tension, r = pore radius, water at 70°C σ = 0.063 N/m, 20 μm pore → Pc = 6,300 Pa), permeability (flow resistance, larger pores = lower resistance but weaker capillary pressure, tradeoff optimization). **Sintering process**: Method 1 - Mandrel sintering (most common for laptop heat pipes). Insert stainless steel or copper mandrel (solid rod, 4-6mm diameter, smooth polished surface) into copper tube. Pour copper powder into annular gap between mandrel and tube inner wall (gap 0.3-0.8mm, controls wick thickness). Vibrate tube (mechanical vibrator or ultrasonic, 20-60 Hz) to pack powder uniformly (density 40-60% of solid copper, porosity 40-60%). Insert assembly into sintering furnace: Hydrogen atmosphere (100% H₂ or 90% N₂/10% H₂, reducing atmosphere prevents oxidation, reduces any existing oxides), temperature 700-850°C (below copper melting point 1,085°C, at solid-state diffusion temperature). Hold time 30-90 minutes (copper particles neck together via solid-state diffusion, forms continuous porous structure, bonds to tube inner wall). Cooling: Furnace cool or controlled rate 2-5°C/min to prevent thermal shock cracking. Withdraw mandrel: Pull out after cooling (wick adheres to tube, mandrel releases cleanly if properly lubricated with graphite or BN before sintering). Result: Sintered wick layer 0.3-0.8mm thick, porosity 45-55%, pore size 15-40 μm, bonded firmly to tube inner wall (shear strength >5 MPa, withstands capillary flow forces and vibration).

**Step 36-58: Alternative Wick Structures - Groove and Mesh Options**
**Axial grooves**: Machine or extrude longitudinal grooves in tube inner surface (50-200 grooves, 0.2-0.5mm wide × 0.1-0.3mm deep). Manufacturing: Broaching (cutting tool pulled through tube), mandrel drawing (tube drawn over grooved mandrel, forms inverse grooves inside), or extrusion (direct extrusion with grooved die). Advantages: Simple, low cost, robust (no loose particles), good vapor flow space. Disadvantages: Lower capillary pressure vs sintered wick (larger effective pore radius 100-300 μm, Pc only 400-1,200 Pa), limits heat transport against gravity or over long distances. Applications: Lower-power devices, short heat pipes (<100mm), gravity-assisted orientations. **Wire mesh wick**: Wrap fine copper or stainless mesh (100-400 mesh, wire diameter 0.025-0.050mm, opening 0.05-0.15mm) around mandrel, insert into tube, sinter or roll-bond to tube wall. Mesh layers: 2-8 wraps (controls wick thickness, capillary pressure). Advantages: Moderate capillary pressure (pore size 30-100 μm, Pc 1,200-4,000 Pa), flexible (conforms to bends), good permeability. Disadvantages: Labor-intensive assembly, risk of mesh shifting during installation. **Composite wicks**: Combine structures (sintered base layer + grooves for return flow, mesh outer + sintered inner for optimized pressure/permeability balance). Used in high-performance applications (server processors, discrete GPU cooling, 150-300W heat loads). **Screen wick**: Single-layer fine mesh (200-400 mesh), simple, low capillarity (pore 50-150 μm, Pc 800-2,500 Pa), suitable only for thin flat heat pipes in laptops where orientation favorable (evaporator below condenser, gravity assists return). MacBook heat pipes primarily use sintered wick (best balance of capillarity, permeability, manufacturability for 3-8mm diameter tubes, 50-100mm lengths, 15-45W heat loads per pipe).

**Step 59-78: Tube Bending and End Cap Preparation**
**Bending heat pipe**: Before final assembly, bend tube to match laptop thermal path (straight section at CPU, 30-90° bend to route around components, straight section to cooling fins). Bending methods: Mandrel bending (flexible mandrel inserted, supports inner wall, prevents collapse, minimum radius 3-5× tube OD, 18-40mm for 6mm tube), rotary draw bending (tube clamped and bent around die). Sintered wick survives bending if done carefully (pre-sinter bend before wick insertion, or post-sinter gentle bend <90°, slow rate, wick cracks if bent too sharply or rapidly, crack limits capillary return, heat pipe fails). **End cap fabrication**: Copper end caps close tube ends (cylindrical plugs 5-8mm diameter × 2-5mm length, machined or stamped from copper bar). End cap features: One cap has fill tube (small tube 1-2mm OD × 10-30mm length, for evacuation and fluid charging, sealed after filling), opposite cap sealed solid. Cap design: Slight interference fit (0.01-0.03mm larger than tube ID, press-fit, then welded). Surface prep: Degrease, pickle in acid (removes oxides, ensures clean weld), rinse DI water. **End cap installation**: Press end caps into tube ends (hydraulic press, 500-2,000 N force, cap inserts 2-4mm deep). Welding: TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding with argon shield (prevents oxidation, copper welds at 1,085°C, heat input 800-1,500 J/cm, weld speed 5-15 cm/min), or laser welding (fiber laser 200-1,000W, focused spot 0.2-0.5mm, fast 10-50 cm/min, precise, minimal heat-affected zone, preferred for thin-wall tubes). Weld inspection: Visual for porosity, cracks, incomplete fusion. Helium leak test: Pressurize with helium 1-3 bar, place in vacuum chamber with helium mass spectrometer (detects leak rate, acceptable <1×10⁻⁸ mbar·L/s, ensures hermetic seal, no air ingress over 10+ year life).

**Step 79-98: Evacuation Process - [Vacuum Equipment](vacuum-pump) for Air Removal**
[Vacuum pump equipment](vacuum-pump): Removes air and moisture from sealed tube (non-condensable gases prevent vapor condensation, drastically reduce heat transfer, heat pipe fails). System: Rotary vane roughing pump (evacuates to 10⁻² mbar) + turbomolecular or diffusion pump (reaches 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁷ mbar). **Evacuation procedure**: Connect fill tube to vacuum manifold (VCR or compression fitting, leak-tight). Evacuate tube: Pump down to <10⁻³ mbar (removes bulk air, 99.9% of atmosphere). Heating during evacuation: Heat tube to 150-200°C using heating tape or oven (desorbs adsorbed moisture and gases from wick and tube walls, water vapor outgasses from copper surfaces, especially sintered wick with high surface area). Pump continuously for 1-4 hours while hot (moisture evaporates, pumped away). Monitor vacuum level: Pirani or ionization vacuum gauge (pressure decreases as outgassing completes, stable vacuum <5×10⁻⁴ mbar indicates dry). **Bakeout completion**: Cool tube to room temperature while still under vacuum (prevents re-adsorption). Final vacuum: 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁶ mbar (ultra-clean, residual gas <0.01% by volume of final working fluid vapor, non-condensables <100 ppm acceptable). **Critical contamination control**: Any oil, grease, or organic contamination decomposes under heat, generates gas, contaminates working fluid (forms acids, corrodes copper, generates more gas). Cleanliness protocol: All parts vapor-degreased or ultrasonically cleaned before assembly, handled with clean gloves, assembled in clean room or laminar flow hood (Class 1,000-10,000, prevents particulate contamination). Leak testing: Before proceeding to charging, isolate heat pipe from pump (valve closure), monitor pressure for 10-60 minutes (pressure rise <10% indicates acceptable leak rate, large rise indicates leak in weld or fitting, reject and re-weld).

**Step 99-118: Fluid Charging - [Working Fluid](deionized-water) Injection**
[Working fluid selection](deionized-water): Water (most common for laptop heat pipes, operating range 0-100°C at atmospheric pressure equivalent, but heat pipe evacuated so boiling point depends on saturation pressure, typically operates 50-90°C where water saturation pressure 0.12-0.70 bar). Water advantages: Highest latent heat of vaporization 2,257 kJ/kg at 100°C (absorbs maximum heat per kg fluid), excellent thermal properties, non-toxic, low cost. Disadvantages: Freezes at 0°C (not issue for laptops, operational environment >0°C), limited to <100°C (adequate for laptop CPUs 70-100°C). Alternative fluids: Methanol (boiling point 65°C @ 1 bar, operates -20 to 80°C range, lower latent heat 1,100 kJ/kg, used for lower-temperature applications), ammonia (−33°C boiling, cryogenic applications), acetone, ethanol. Fluid purity: Deionized water resistivity >1 MΩ·cm, filtered 0.2 μm (removes particles that could clog wick pores), degassed (dissolved air removed by boiling or vacuum degassing, air forms bubbles, blocks vapor flow). **Charging procedure**: Prepare fluid charge (calculate fluid mass, 0.5-2.0 grams per 6mm × 150mm heat pipe, enough to saturate wick with thin liquid film, excess floods vapor space and reduces performance, insufficient dries out evaporator). Measure precisely: Analytical balance ±0.001g (±1 mg accuracy). Transfer fluid to heat pipe: Method 1 - Direct injection via syringe through fill tube (tube still under vacuum, open valve slowly, vacuum sucks fluid in, measure fluid container before/after to confirm charge mass). Method 2 - Vapor charging (heat water in separate chamber connected to heat pipe, water evaporates, vapor flows into heat pipe, condenses on cold walls, accumulates liquid, control by temperature and time). Method 3 - Break-seal ampoule (pre-weighed fluid sealed in glass ampoule attached to fill tube, evacuate system, break ampoule, fluid drawn in by vacuum). Verify charge: Weigh entire heat pipe before/after charging (difference = fluid mass ±0.005g). **Seal fill tube**: Pinch-off method (clamp fill tube flat with pliers, TIG or laser weld across pinched section, forms hermetic seal, excess tube cut off). Alternative: Crimp seal (mechanical crimp, then weld, or use copper compression fitting swaged and welded). Leak check: Helium leak test again (verify seal integrity, <1×10⁻⁸ mbar·L/s). Final vacuum level: Tube contains working fluid vapor at saturation pressure (0.1-0.5 bar at room temperature for water-charged pipe, equilibrium between liquid and vapor).

**Step 119-138: Flattening Process - [Hydraulic Press](hydraulic-press) for Thin Profile**
[Flattening press](hydraulic-press): Laptop heat pipes flattened from 6mm round to 2-4mm thick (reduces height, fits in thin laptop chassis 10-15mm total thickness). Flattening changes cross-section from circular to oval or rectangular. **Process**: Heat pipe positioned between flat press platens (hardened steel, polished surface). Hydraulic press applies force 5-20 tonnes (50-200 kN), compresses tube slowly (1-5 mm/min advance) to target thickness. Press controls: Force or position control (modern presses servo-controlled, achieve exact thickness ±0.05mm). Temperature: Room temperature or mild heat 50-100°C (heating reduces yield strength, easier forming, less spring-back). **Flattening constraints**: Cannot flatten too much (excessive flattening closes vapor space, blocks vapor flow from evaporator to condenser). Practical limit: Flattening ratio (final thickness / original diameter) >0.30 (6mm tube → minimum 1.8mm thickness, typical 2.5-4.0mm for functional vapor flow). Vapor space requirement: Cross-sectional area for vapor flow >5-10 mm² (maintains low pressure drop, vapor velocity <50 m/s, higher velocity increases pressure drop, limits heat transport capacity). **Wick integrity during flattening**: Sintered wick compresses but remains functional if porosity maintained (compression densifies wick slightly, pore size reduces 10-30%, capillary pressure increases marginally, acceptable if pores don't close completely). Excessive flattening cracks wick (fractures disrupt capillary network, fluid cannot return to evaporator, dry-out failure). Grooved wicks tolerate flattening better (grooves deform but channels remain open). **Selective flattening**: Flatten only center section (cold plate contact area at CPU, 20-40mm length, maximizes thermal contact area, reduces interface resistance), leave round sections at bends and ends (maintains vapor flow capacity, easier to route and attach to fins). **Post-flattening**: Verify thickness uniformity (micrometer measurement, ±0.1mm tolerance), check for leaks (flattening stresses welds, pressure test 5 bar air submerged in water, no bubbles confirms seal integrity).

**Step 139-158: Thermal Performance Testing - [Thermal Test Equipment](thermal-test) Validation**
[Thermal testing](thermal-test): Validates heat pipe performance before shipping. **Test setup**: Mount heat pipe on thermal test bench. Heater block (aluminum or copper, cartridge heaters 10-100W, thermocouples embedded, simulates CPU heat source) attached to evaporator end (thermal grease interface, minimizes contact resistance). Cold plate (water-cooled aluminum block, 15-25°C coolant temperature, simulates laptop cooling fins/chassis) attached to condenser end. Insulate heat pipe (fiberglass or foam, prevents ambient heat loss, ensures heat flows evaporator to condenser only). **Instrumentation**: T-type thermocouples (copper-constantan, ±0.5°C accuracy) at evaporator, adiabatic section (middle, should be intermediate temperature), condenser. Data logger records temperatures vs time. Power supply to heaters (DC power, measure voltage and current, calculate power input Q = V × I). **Test procedure**: Apply heat load 10-50W (depends on heat pipe size, 6mm × 150mm handles 20-40W). Wait for steady-state (temperatures stabilize, 10-30 minutes). Record temperatures: T_evap, T_cond. Calculate thermal resistance R = (T_evap - T_cond) / Q (units K/W or °C/W). Typical laptop heat pipe: R = 0.2-0.5 K/W @ 20-30W (evaporator 10-15°C hotter than condenser, effective thermal conductivity κ_eff = L / (A × R) = 0.15m / (20×10⁻⁶ m² × 0.3 K/W) = 25,000 W/m·K, far exceeds solid copper 400 W/m·K). **Acceptance criteria**: Thermal resistance <0.6 K/W (efficient), temperature distribution smooth (no hot spots indicating dry-out or blockage), evaporator temperature <100°C @ 30W (avoids water boiling limit, pressure <1 bar gauge). **Failure modes during test**: High thermal resistance R >1.0 K/W indicates non-condensable gas (air leak, inadequate evacuation, contamination), evaporator overheats >120°C at moderate power indicates dry-out (insufficient fluid charge, wick flooding, capillary limit exceeded), condenser section stays cold indicates blockage (ice plug if water-charged pipe tested <0°C, or solid particle blocking vapor path). **Orientation testing**: Test heat pipe in multiple orientations (horizontal, evaporator below condenser gravity-assisted, evaporator above condenser gravity-opposed). Gravity-opposed most challenging (capillary pressure must overcome hydrostatic pressure ΔP_hydro = ρ_liquid × g × h, water at 70°C ρ = 978 kg/m³, h = 0.10m vertical rise → ΔP = 960 Pa, requires wick capillary pressure Pc >1,000 Pa, achieved with sintered wick pore size <30 μm). Laptop heat pipes typically operate nearly horizontal (slight tilt, gravity assists slightly), tested 0-45° tilt range.

**Step 159-178: Final Assembly - Integration and Quality Control**
**Surface treatment**: Clean heat pipe exterior (ultrasonic in isopropyl alcohol, removes press oils, fingerprints, residues), polish flat surfaces (Scotch-Brite pad or sandpaper 320-600 grit, smooths contact surfaces, improves thermal interface to CPU and cold plate, surface roughness Ra <3 μm target). Nickel plating optional (5-10 μm Ni, improves corrosion resistance, wetting with thermal paste, aesthetic bright finish, adds $0.20-0.50 cost). **Attachment features**: Solder fins to condenser end (aluminum or copper fins, 0.1-0.3mm thick, 8-15mm tall, 20-40 fins per 30mm length, increases surface area 10-30×, enhances convection heat dissipation). Solder process: Flux application, dip in molten solder bath (60/40 Sn-Pb or lead-free SAC305, 220-260°C, 2-5 seconds), or wave soldering (conveyor passes heat pipe over solder wave, fins pre-assembled). Solder joint thermal resistance <0.05 K/W (thin bond line 0.05-0.2mm). Alternative: Mechanical crimping (fins crimped onto flattened heat pipe, no solder, lower thermal conductance, cost savings). **Mounting brackets**: Attach copper or aluminum brackets (screw holes align with laptop chassis mounting points, spring clips for compression against CPU). Brackets laser welded or brazed to heat pipe. **Thermal paste application**: Apply thin layer of thermal interface material to CPU contact area (pre-applied at factory, phase-change material or thermal grease, ensures gap filling, thermal conductivity 3-8 W/m·K, bond-line thickness 0.05-0.15mm controlled by assembly pressure). **Final inspection**: Visual (weld quality, surface finish, fin attachment), dimensional (length ±0.5mm, thickness ±0.1mm, flatness <0.2mm), leak test (X-ray fluoroscopy detects internal fluid level, confirms charge, or pressure decay test), thermal test (sample basis 1-5% of production). **Packaging**: Anti-static bag (ESD protection for fins/brackets with electronics nearby), foam tray or cardboard divider (prevents damage to fins during shipping), box label (part number, thermal rating W, orientation requirements). **Traceability**: Laser etch serial number or 2D data matrix on heat pipe body (enables tracking to production batch, test data, field failure analysis). Batch testing: Each production lot (500-5,000 pieces) undergoes sample thermal validation (10 samples minimum, calculate mean thermal resistance, standard deviation, verify within specification limits).

**Step 179-195: Advanced Designs, Market Trends, and Economics**
**Vapor chamber evolution**: Laptop heat pipes evolving toward vapor chambers (flat sealed chamber 50-100mm × 30-60mm × 1-3mm thick, internal sintered wick covers both surfaces, vapor space in middle). Advantages over traditional round heat pipes: Planar heat spreading (dissipates hot spots from CPU chiplets, reduces peak temperature 5-15°C), thinner profile (1.5-2.5mm vs 3-4mm flattened heat pipe), larger effective thermal conductivity (κ_eff 30,000-100,000 W/m·K planar). Disadvantages: Higher cost ($8-20 vs $4-6 for heat pipe), complex manufacturing (wick sintering on flat plates, welding perimeter seal, flattening heat pipe simpler). Applications: High-end gaming laptops (Razen 9, Core i9 processors, 45-65W TDP), workstations (discrete GPUs 60-150W). MacBook Pro 14"/16" M3 Max uses hybrid system (multiple heat pipes + small vapor chamber over hotspot areas). **Heat pipe materials**: Copper dominates (highest thermal conductivity 400 W/m·K, excellent ductility for forming, widely available). Aluminum heat pipes (lower cost 30-50%, weight savings 70% vs copper, but lower thermal conductivity 200 W/m·K, limited wick options, used in budget laptops, tablets). Stainless steel (corrosion resistant for harsh environments, but poor thermal conductivity 16 W/m·K, not used in laptops). **Working fluid trends**: Water remains standard (0-100°C laptop range optimal), but advanced fluids investigated (nanofluids: water + 0.1-1% nanoparticles Cu, Al₂O₃, CNT, claims 10-40% thermal conductivity enhancement, but mixed results, particle settling, clogging wick pores, commercial adoption limited). Low-GWP refrigerants (HFO-1234yf, HFO-1233zd, replacing HFC-134a in high-temperature applications 80-150°C, environmental regulations). **Pulsating heat pipes**: Serpentine tube (no wick, 1-2mm ID, partially filled 40-60% with working fluid, vapor bubbles and liquid slugs oscillate due to evaporation/condensation, chaotic pumping action). Advantages: Simple (no wick, lower cost), works in gravity-opposed orientations. Disadvantages: Less predictable performance, requires multiple bends (10-20 turns minimum for self-sustained oscillation), noise (pulsation audible in quiet environments), not widely adopted in laptops yet. **Cost breakdown per heat pipe**: Copper tube $1.20 (20g @ $5/kg material = $0.10, yield loss and scrap $0.15, cutting and cleaning $0.20, bending $0.25, end caps $0.10, welding $0.40), sintered wick $0.80 (copper powder $0.15, mandrel and sintering furnace time $0.35, hydrogen atmosphere $0.05, labor $0.15, inspection $0.10), working fluid $0.15 (DI water negligible cost $0.001, degassing and preparation $0.03, charging equipment amortization $0.08, seal-off welding $0.04), vacuum processing $0.60 (vacuum pump and manifold $0.25, heating during bakeout $0.10, leak testing $0.15, technician time $0.10), flattening $0.45 (press time $0.20, tooling $0.10, inspection $0.15), testing $0.40 (thermal test bench $0.15, data collection $0.10, rework and rejects $0.15), labor $0.40 (assembly, handling, packaging $0.25, overhead burden $0.15), total $4.50. OEM pays $4-7 depending on specifications (length, diameter, flattening profile, thermal performance guarantee, volume commitment). **Production volume**: Global heat pipe market 500-800 million units/year (laptops 200M, desktops 50M, servers 20M, smartphones 150M, tablets 50M, LED lighting 100M, other 100M). Laptop heat pipes: Average 1-3 per laptop (thin ultrabooks 1 pipe, gaming laptops 2-3 pipes + vapor chamber), 200M laptops × 1.5 pipes = 300M laptop heat pipe demand annually. Market concentration: Taiwan dominates 60% (Auras, Cooler Master, Forcecon, Delta), Japan 20% (Furukawa Electric, Fujikura), China 15%, rest 5%. **Sustainability**: Heat pipes extend laptop life (efficient cooling prevents thermal throttling, reduces component degradation, extends usable life 1-2 years), recyclable (copper recovered at >95% efficiency, melted and refined), low energy manufacturing (no powered pumps or fans in heat pipe itself, passive operation consumes zero energy).
