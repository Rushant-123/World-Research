Rubber toughening modifiers are specialized additives used to dramatically improve the fracture toughness and impact resistance of epoxy adhesives and composites. These materials include CTBN (carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile) liquid rubbers and core-shell particles (MBS, acrylic-based) that create a dispersed rubber phase within the brittle epoxy matrix. The manufacturing process involves controlled polymerization, functionalization, emulsion processing, and spray drying to produce particles with precise size distributions (100-300 nm) and optimized rubber content. Kaneka Corporation produces advanced rubber modifiers that increase fracture toughness (K1c) by 150-300%, improve peel strength by 400-600%, and enhance impact resistance through crack deflection and cavitation mechanisms.
