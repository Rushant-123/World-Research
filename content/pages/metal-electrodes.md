1. Mine metal ore from geological deposits containing economically extractable concentrations of Metal Electrodes base metal

2. Transport ore from mine to processing facility using haul trucks or conveyor systems

3. Crush ore in jaw crusher and gyratory crusher reducing particle size to <150 mm

4. Grind crushed ore in ball mill or SAG mill achieving 80% passing 200 mesh (74 microns)

5. Add water and grinding media (steel balls) creating slurry for effective grinding

6. Classify ground ore using hydrocyclones separating oversize particles for re-grinding

7. Concentrate metal values using froth flotation process with selective surfactants

8. Add collector reagents (xanthates) selectively adsorbing on valuable mineral surfaces

9. Inject frother chemicals creating stable bubbles to carry hydrophobic minerals to froth layer

10. Skim metal-rich froth from flotation cells achieving 25-40% metal content in concentrate

11. Filter concentrate using vacuum disc filters or pressure filters removing excess water

12. Dry concentrate in rotary dryer or flash dryer reducing moisture to <10%

13. Transport concentrate to smelter facility for pyrometallurgical extraction

14. Blend concentrate with flux materials (limestone, silica) to control slag composition

15. Charge concentrate blend into smelting furnace (flash, reverberatory, or electric arc type)

16. Heat furnace to 1200-1400°C using natural gas burners or electric arc electrodes

17. Melt concentrate separating into matte (metal sulfide) and slag (oxide waste) layers

18. Tap molten matte from furnace bottom transferring to converting vessel

19. Blow compressed air or oxygen through molten matte oxidizing iron and sulfur impurities

20. Remove slag layer continuously as it forms capturing iron oxides and other impurities

21. Continue converting until reaching blister metal stage with 98-99% metal purity

22. Cast blister metal into anode shapes for electrorefining process

23. Transfer anodes to electrorefining tankhouse equipped with hundreds of electrolytic cells

24. Hang impure anodes and pure starter sheet cathodes in sulfuric acid electrolyte bath

25. Apply DC current at controlled voltage (0.2-0.3V) driving metal dissolution from anodes

26. Plate pure metal onto cathodes achieving 99.99% purity through electrorefining

27. Allow cathodes to build thickness to 10-15 mm over 10-14 days electrolysis time

28. Remove cathodes from cells and strip deposited metal plates from starter sheets

29. Wash cathode plates with water removing electrolyte residue and surface contamination

30. Inspect cathode quality checking for smoothness, uniformity, and absence of nodules

31. Load cathode plates into gas-fired or induction melting furnace for ingot casting

32. Heat furnace to melting temperature (specific to each metal: 660°C Al, 1085°C Cu, 420°C Zn)

33. Melt cathodes under protective atmosphere or flux cover preventing oxidation

34. Add alloying elements if producing alloy ingots rather than pure metal ingots

35. Stir molten metal thoroughly ensuring homogeneous composition throughout melt

36. Degas molten metal using nitrogen or argon purge removing dissolved hydrogen

37. Flux molten metal surface removing oxide dross and impurities to ladle

38. Sample molten metal analyzing composition by optical emission spectroscopy

39. Verify chemistry meets specification for alloying elements and impurity limits

40. Pre-heat ingot molds to 150-200°C preventing thermal shock and cold shuts during casting

41. Transfer molten metal from furnace to casting ladles using overhead cranes

42. Pour metal into ingot molds at controlled rate avoiding turbulence and air entrainment

43. Fill molds completely ensuring no voids or shrinkage cavities in ingot

44. Allow ingots to solidify and cool in molds for specified time based on section thickness

45. Directionally solidify from bottom to top concentrating porosity in feeder head (to be cropped)

46. Remove solidified ingots from molds using hydraulic press or knockout machine

47. Crop feeder head and bottom of ingot removing shrinkage cavity and contaminated ends

48. Surface grind or scalp ingots removing oxide scale and surface defects

49. Inspect ingot surface for cracks, laps, seams, and other casting defects

50. Measure ingot dimensions verifying thickness, width, and length within tolerance

51. Mark ingots with heat number, alloy designation, and date code using stamping or painting

52. Sample ingot material for chemical analysis drilling chips from representative locations

53. Perform spectrochemical analysis measuring all alloying elements and impurities

54. Test mechanical properties on cast samples including hardness, tensile strength, elongation

55. Bundle ingots using steel strapping preparing for storage or shipment

56. Store ingots in covered warehouse protecting from weather and contamination

57. Prepare certificate of analysis documenting chemistry and test results for each heat

58. Package ingots on wooden pallets with protective covering preventing surface damage

59. Load pallets onto flatbed trucks or rail cars using forklifts or overhead cranes

60. Ship Metal Electrodes to rolling mills, extrusion plants, foundries, and metal fabricators for further processing into semi-finished products like sheet, plate, rod, wire, and tube used in automotive, aerospace, construction, electrical, and consumer goods industries
