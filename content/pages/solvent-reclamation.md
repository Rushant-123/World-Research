Solvent reclamation systems recover and recycle solvents from coating, cleaning, and chemical processing operations. These systems capture solvent-laden air streams, extract pure solvents through distillation, and return them to production, reducing raw material costs and environmental emissions. Modern reclamation systems achieve 95-98% solvent recovery with purity levels exceeding 99.5%, meeting strict VOC emission limits while providing rapid payback through material savings.
