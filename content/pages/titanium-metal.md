# Titanium Metal Production Supply Chain

**Market Leader:** [VSMPO-AVISMA](/companies/vsmpo-avisma)



## Overview
Titanium metal production is a complex metallurgical process primarily using the Kroll process, which converts titanium dioxide (TiO2) from rutile ore into metallic titanium through chlorination and magnesium reduction.

## Supply Chain Steps

### Phase 1: Ore Extraction and Preparation (Steps 1-25)

**Step 1:** Geological surveys identify titanium-bearing mineral deposits
**Step 2:** Core sampling determines ore grade and deposit size
**Step 3:** Environmental impact assessments conducted
**Step 4:** Mining permits and licenses obtained
**Step 5:** Mine site preparation and infrastructure development
**Step 6:** Heavy earth-moving equipment deployed to site
**Step 7:** Overburden removal exposes ore-bearing layers
**Step 8:** Rutile ore (TiO2 95-98% purity) extracted via open-pit mining
**Step 9:** Ilmenite ore (TiO2 45-65% purity) extracted as alternative source
**Step 10:** Primary crushing reduces ore to 150-200mm fragments
**Step 11:** Ore transported to processing facility via conveyors
**Step 12:** Secondary crushing reduces size to 20-50mm
**Step 13:** Magnetic separation removes iron-bearing minerals
**Step 14:** Gravity separation concentrates heavy titanium minerals
**Step 15:** Electrostatic separation isolates rutile from other minerals
**Step 16:** Spiral concentrators further purify titanium content
**Step 17:** Flotation process removes remaining impurities
**Step 18:** Concentrate dried to remove moisture
**Step 19:** Quality testing confirms TiO2 content above 90%
**Step 20:** Concentrate stockpiled for processing
**Step 21:** For ilmenite: beneficiation increases TiO2 to 85-90%
**Step 22:** Sulfuric acid digestion removes iron from ilmenite
**Step 23:** Synthetic rutile produced from upgraded ilmenite
**Step 24:** Final concentrate blending for consistent feedstock
**Step 25:** Transport to chlorination facility

## Key Technical Parameters

- **Kroll Reaction Temperature:** 850-900°C
- **TiCl4 Purity:** >99.9%
- **Magnesium Purity:** >99.8%
- **Vacuum Level:** <10^-4 torr
- **Titanium Sponge Purity:** >99.5%
- **Final Metal Purity:** >99.7%
- **Energy Consumption:** 45-50 MWh per ton titanium
- **Production Cycle:** 7-14 days per batch

## Environmental Considerations

Titanium production is energy-intensive and generates significant chlorine byproducts that must be recycled. Magnesium chloride can be recovered and electrolyzed to reclaim both magnesium and chlorine, improving process sustainability. Modern facilities implement closed-loop chlorine systems and waste heat recovery to minimize environmental impact.
