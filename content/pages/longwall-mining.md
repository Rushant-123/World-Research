1. Coal seam accessed via shaft or drift mine
2. Development roadways driven to block boundaries
3. Longwall panel dimensions: 200-400m wide, 2-5km long
4. Gate roads developed on each side of panel
5. Face-end equipment installed
6. Armored face conveyor (AFC) positioned
7. Hydraulic roof supports placed along face (150-200 shields)
8. Each shield capacity: 1,000-1,500 tons
9. Longwall shearer mounted on AFC
10. Shearer passes along face cutting coal
11. Rotating drums with carbide picks
12. Coal cut in 0.8-1.2 meter web
13. Coal falls onto AFC and transported to gate
14. Shields advance hydraulically after each cut
15. Roof caves in controlled manner behind shields
16. Shearer makes bi-directional cuts
17. Cutting cycle time: 2-4 hours
18. Daily advance: 5-10 meters
19. Ventilation maintained through gates
20. Dust suppression with water sprays
21. Methane monitoring continuous
22. Face auto mation reduces crew requirements
23. Remote monitoring from surface
24. Production rate: 5,000-15,000 tons per day
25. Panel mining continues for 6-18 months
26. Equipment recovery at panel end
27. Shields, conveyor, shearer moved to next panel
28. Relocation takes 1-3 months
29. Subsidence monitoring on surface
30. Ground movement typically 50-90% of seam thickness
31. Surface structures protected or relocated
32. Continuous improvement of equipment reliability
