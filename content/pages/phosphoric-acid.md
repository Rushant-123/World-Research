# How to Make Phosphoric Acid (H₃PO₄)

Weak acid used in semiconductor aluminum etching, metal surface treatment, fertilizers, food acidulant (cola). Two production routes: wet process (from phosphate rock) for industrial/fertilizer grade, thermal process (burning phosphorus) for electronic/food grade.

**Step 1-8: [Phosphate Rock](phosphate-ore) Mining and Preparation**
Mine phosphate rock (phosphorite) - sedimentary deposits containing 30-40% P₂O₅. Major deposits: Morocco (75% world reserves), China, USA (Florida, North Carolina). Open pit mining with draglines, shovels, trucks. Crush ore to 25-50mm in jaw crusher, then 5-10mm in cone crusher. Screen to remove clay and sand. Beneficiation by flotation: add fatty acid collectors (oleic acid), depress silica with sodium silicate. P₂O₅ content after beneficiation: 30-35%. Dry in rotary kiln at 150°C to <1% moisture. Grind to 75 µm (-200 mesh) in ball mill. Final product: phosphate rock powder, 32-34% P₂O₅, 48-52% CaO.

**Step 9-18: Wet Process - Attack with [Sulfuric Acid](sulfuric-acid)**
Wet process produces industrial grade (75-85% H₃PO₄). In glass-lined or stainless steel [reactor tank](glass-lined-reactor), add 1,000 kg ground phosphate rock. Add 1,800 kg concentrated sulfuric acid (93-98% H₂SO₄) slowly over 30 minutes. Reaction: Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 3H₂SO₄ → 2H₃PO₄ + 3CaSO₄. Highly exothermic - temperature rises to 80-90°C. Cool with water jacket, maintain 75-85°C. Reaction time: 4-6 hours with continuous stirring at 60 rpm. Forms calcium sulfate (gypsum) as byproduct. Gypsum crystallizes in three forms depending on temperature: dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O) at 70-80°C, hemihydrate (CaSO₄·0.5H₂O) at 85-100°C, anhydrite (CaSO₄) at >100°C. Dihydrate process most common. Yield: 500 kg H₃PO₄ (as 100% P₂O₅ equivalent), 1,900 kg gypsum (wet).

**Step 19-28: Filtration**
Separate gypsum from phosphoric acid by [filtration](filter-press). Use rotary vacuum filter or tilting pan filter. Filter cloth: polypropylene or polyester. Vacuum: 0.3-0.5 bar. Filtration rate: 500-1,000 kg/m²/hour. Gypsum cake: 30-40% moisture. Wash cake with water (3 stages) to recover entrained acid. Filtrate: 28-32% P₂O₅ (equivalent to 40-46% H₃PO₄). Dark green-brown color from impurities: Fe, Al, Mg, fluorides, organics, suspended solids. Gypsum byproduct: 5 tonnes per tonne P₂O₅. Used in construction (wallboard, cement retarder) or discarded as waste (phosphogypsum stacks).

**Step 29-38: Clarification and Purification**
Settle crude acid in tanks for 24-48 hours. Solids sink - remove bottom sludge. Add flocculants (polyacrylamide) to speed settling. Crude acid contains: 30% P₂O₅, 1-2% Fe₂O₃, 0.5-1% Al₂O₃, 2-3% SO₄, 1% F. For merchant grade (fertilizer use): concentrate directly by evaporation. For food/electronic grade: purify first. Methods: solvent extraction (tributyl phosphate extracts H₃PO₄, leaves impurities), ion exchange (removes metals), precipitation (add lime to precipitate Fe/Al as phosphates, filter, acidify). Electronic grade route: use thermal process instead (cleaner).

**Step 39-50: Concentration by [Evaporation](vacuum-evaporator)**
Concentrate from 30% P₂O₅ to 54% P₂O₅ (75% H₃PO₄) in evaporator. Use vacuum evaporator to reduce boiling point (prevent thermal decomposition). Pressure: 50-150 mbar. Boiling point: 80-120°C (vs 158°C at atmospheric pressure). Multi-effect evaporator: use steam from first effect to heat second effect. 3-4 effects typical. Feed rate: 10,000 kg/hour crude acid. Steam consumption: 1.2 kg steam/kg water evaporated. Materials: stainless steel (316L) or graphite (resists hot concentrated acid). Concentration time: 4-8 hours. Product: merchant grade 54% P₂O₅ (equivalent to 75% H₃PO₄), dark brown, syrupy liquid, specific gravity 1.58.

**Step 51-60: Thermal Process for High Purity**
Electronic-grade requires thermal process (furnace method). Burn white phosphorus in excess air: P₄ + 5O₂ → P₄O₁₀. Phosphorus pentoxide (actually P₄O₁₀) is white powder. Absorb in water: P₄O₁₀ + 6H₂O → 4H₃PO₄. Extremely exothermic - heat to 200°C. Cool and concentrate. Product: 85% H₃PO₄, colorless, metals <1 ppm. Further purify by recrystallization: cool to 20°C, H₃PO₄·0.5H₂O crystals form. Centrifuge, wash with cold water, redissolve. Final purity: 85-90% H₃PO₄, metals <10 ppb. Price: $15-30/kg (vs $1-2/kg for wet process acid). White phosphorus made by: reduce phosphate rock with coke in electric arc furnace at 1,500°C, phosphorus vaporizes, condense. Energy intensive: 13-15 MWh/tonne P.

**Step 61-70: Electronic Grade Specifications**
Semiconductor use: aluminum etch at 160-180°C. Requires ultra-high purity. Start with thermal process acid (85%). Distill under vacuum (10 mbar, 150°C) in quartz still. Collect middle fraction. Test by ICP-MS: each metal (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni) <1 ppb. Test chloride: <0.1 ppm. Test sulfate: <0.1 ppm. Test fluoride: <0.1 ppm. Particle count: <10 particles/mL >0.1 µm. Filter through 0.05 µm PTFE membrane in cleanroom. Package in PTFE bottles under nitrogen blanket. Concentration: 85% ±0.5%. Store in PTFE-lined or polyethylene containers.

**Step 71-80: Storage and Handling**
Wet-process acid: store in glass-lined steel, stainless steel (316L), or FRP (fiber-reinforced plastic) tanks. Tank size: 50,000-200,000 liters for production facility. Thermal-process acid: store in polyethylene, polypropylene, or PTFE containers. Avoid aluminum (forms protective layer but contaminates acid). Maintain 15-25°C. Avoid freezing - 85% H₃PO₄ freezes at 21°C. If crystallization occurs, warm gently to 40°C. Acid is non-volatile, doesn't fume. Stable indefinitely if kept sealed (absorbs moisture from air, dilutes over time). Secondary containment required for tanks >5,000 liters.

**Step 81-90: Application in Semiconductor Processing**
Aluminum etch: heat 85% H₃PO₄ to 160-180°C in PTFE or quartz bath. Immerse wafer with aluminum layer. Etch rate: 1,000-3,000 Å/min. Temperature control critical: ±2°C affects rate by ±10%. Selectivity to oxide: 20:1 (etches Al faster than SiO₂). Selectivity to photoresist: 10:1. Used to pattern Al metal layers in older processes (0.35 µm and larger). Newer processes use plasma etching (dry etch with Cl₂/BCl₃) for better control. After etch: rinse in DI water cascade (5 tanks), dry with nitrogen. Check etch profile by SEM.

**Step 91-100: Safety and Waste Treatment**
Mild acid - less hazardous than HCl or H₂SO₄. Causes burns on prolonged contact. Wear gloves (nitrile or neoprene), safety glasses, apron. Hot concentrated acid (160-180°C) is severe hazard - use face shield, heat-resistant gloves. Vapors at high temperature irritate respiratory system - use fume hood. Spill cleanup: neutralize with soda ash (sodium carbonate) or lime (calcium hydroxide). H₃PO₄ + 3NaOH → Na₃PO₄ + 3H₂O. Resulting sodium phosphate solution can be discharged to wastewater treatment (phosphates precipitate as calcium phosphate in treatment plant). Spent etchant contains dissolved aluminum - precipitate as aluminum phosphate by adding lime, filter, dispose as non-hazardous waste. Phosphate waste regulated due to eutrophication risk in waterways. Price: $1-2/kg for wet-process industrial grade (54% P₂O₅). $15-30/kg for thermal-process electronic grade (85%, high purity).
