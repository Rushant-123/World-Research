1. Heap leach pad construction
2. Pad foundation graded and compacted
3. Liner system installed
4. Primary liner: HDPE geomembrane (1.5-2.5mm)
5. Secondary liner for leak detection
6. Drainage layer: crushed rock (300-600mm)
7. Collection pipes in herringbone pattern
8. Ore crushed to minus 50mm or agglomerated
9. Agglomeration adds acid and water
10. Disc or drum agglomerators
11. Agglomerates: 10-30mm diameter
12. Stacking with conveyor or truck
13. Lift height: 6-10 meters
14. Total heap height: 30-100 meters
15. Heap area: several hectares
16. Drip irrigation system installed
17. Emitters spaced 0.5-1.0 meters
18. Leach solution: sulfuric acid for copper
19. Or cyanide solution for gold
20. Application rate: 5-20 liters per hour per m²
21. Solution percolates through ore
22. Dissolution of metal values
23. Copper: CuO + H2SO4 → CuSO4 + H2O
24. Gold: 4Au + 8NaCN + O2 + 2H2O → 4NaAu(CN)2 + 4NaOH
25. Leach cycle: 30-365 days
26. Pregnant leach solution (PLS) collects at pad bottom
27. PLS pond stores solution
28. Processing: solvent extraction for copper
29. Or carbon adsorption for gold
30. Metal recovery: 60-85%
31. Barren solution returned to heap
32. Make-up acid or cyanide added
33. Water balance managed
34. Evaporation losses
35. Stormwater management
36. Spent ore rinsed after cycle
37. Neutralization with lime
38. Reclamation: capping and revegetation
39. Environmental monitoring: groundwater wells
40. Heap leaching advantages: low cost, treats low-grade ore
41. Disadvantages: long cycle time, weather dependent
42. Production: 5,000-50,000 tons metal per year per operation
