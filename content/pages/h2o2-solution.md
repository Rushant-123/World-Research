Strong oxidizer used in semiconductor wafer cleaning (RCA clean, SC-1 solution), printed circuit board etching, chemical synthesis, bleaching, disinfection. H₂O₂ is unstable - decomposes to water and oxygen. Must be stabilized and handled carefully.

**Step 1-10: Anthraquinone Process Overview**
Modern production: indirect synthesis via anthraquinone auto-oxidation (AO process). Developed by BASF in 1930s, now universal. Direct synthesis (H₂ + O₂ → H₂O₂) is explosive - not used commercially. AO process uses [anthraquinone](organic-feedstock) (C₁₄H₈O₂) as carrier molecule. Cyclic process: anthraquinone + H₂ → anthrahydroquinone. Anthrahydroquinone + O₂ → anthraquinone + H₂O₂. Anthraquinone is regenerated - acts as catalyst. Working solution: 15-20% anthraquinone derivative (2-ethylanthraquinone or 2-amylanthraquinone) dissolved in mixed [solvent](industrial-solvent) (aromatics + esters). Solvent: 70% aromatic (toluene, xylene) + 30% ester (tributyl phosphate, dioctyl phthalate). Aromatic dissolves anthraquinone, ester dissolves anthrahydroquinone.

**Step 11-22: Hydrogenation Stage**
In [reactor vessel](chemical-reactor) (fixed-bed or slurry reactor), charge 1,000 liters working solution (anthraquinone in solvent). Add [palladium catalyst](palladium-metal) (0.1% Pd on alumina support, particle size 3-5mm for fixed bed, or 50 µm powder for slurry). Introduce [hydrogen gas](hydrogen-gas) (99.9% pure) at 2-4 bar pressure, 40-60°C. Reaction: C₁₄H₈O₂ + H₂ → C₁₄H₁₀O₂ (anthraquinone → anthrahydroquinone). Exothermic: 110 kJ/mol. Temperature rises - cool with jacket to maintain 50°C. Contact time: 15-30 minutes in fixed bed reactor. Conversion: 50-70% of anthraquinone reduced per pass. Exit gas: residual H₂ + solvent vapors. Recover H₂ by cooling to -40°C (condenses solvent, H₂ remains gas), recycle. Working solution now contains mix of anthraquinone and anthrahydroquinone.

**Step 23-34: Oxidation Stage**
Transfer hydrogenated solution to oxidation column (bubble column or packed tower). 5-10 meters tall. Inject [air or oxygen](oxygen-gas) from bottom at 1-3 bar, 40-60°C. Reaction: C₁₄H₁₀O₂ + O₂ → C₁₄H₈O₂ + H₂O₂ (anthrahydroquinone → anthraquinone + peroxide). Oxygen dissolves in working solution, reacts with anthrahydroquinone. Non-catalytic, spontaneous. Reaction time: 30-60 minutes. Conversion: 95-99% of anthrahydroquinone oxidized. Anthraquinone regenerated - returns to hydrogenation reactor (cyclic process). H₂O₂ forms in working solution at 1-2% concentration. Exit gas: excess O₂ + N₂ (if air used) + solvent vapors. Scrub with water to recover solvent vapors.

**Step 35-46: Extraction**
H₂O₂ is water-soluble, working solution is organic - separate by liquid-liquid extraction. In extraction column (countercurrent, packed with Raschig rings or structured packing), feed oxidized working solution from top. Spray [demineralized water](ultra-pure-water) from bottom (10:1 water:organic ratio). H₂O₂ transfers to water phase. Extract at 40-50°C. Efficiency: 95-98% H₂O₂ extracted. Aqueous solution: 20-40% H₂O₂. Organic working solution (now depleted in H₂O₂) returns to hydrogenation reactor - continuous cycle. Small losses of anthraquinone and solvent - make up by adding fresh chemicals (0.1-0.5 kg/tonne H₂O₂).

**Step 47-58: Purification and Concentration**
Crude extract contains: 25% H₂O₂, 75% water, traces of organic impurities, anthraquinone degradation products. Purify by fractional distillation under vacuum (prevent decomposition). [Distillation column](chemical-distillation): glass or aluminum construction (stainless steel catalyzes H₂O₂ decomposition). Pressure: 30-100 mbar. Temperature: 50-90°C. Water (more volatile) distills overhead, H₂O₂ concentrates in bottom. Can concentrate to 70-85% H₂O₂. Beyond 70% becomes shock-sensitive. Commercial grades: 35%, 50%, 70%. Semiconductor grade: 30-31% (H₂O₂:H₂O = 1:2.3 by volume, used in RCA clean).

**Step 59-68: Stabilization**
H₂O₂ decomposes: 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂. Decomposition accelerated by: heat, light, alkalinity, transition metals (Fe, Cu, Mn), organic matter. Add stabilizers to prevent decomposition: sodium stannate (Na₂SnO₃, 10-50 ppm), sodium pyrophosphate (Na₄P₂O₇, 10-100 ppm), or colloidal silica (SiO₂, 50-200 ppm). Stabilizers chelate metal ions, maintain pH 3-4 (acidic - more stable). Phosphoric acid added to adjust pH. Electronic-grade stabilizers: ultra-pure phosphoric acid only (avoid metal-containing stabilizers). Decomposition rate: <0.5% per year at 25°C with proper stabilization.

**Step 69-78: Electronic Grade Specifications**
Semiconductor applications require ultra-high purity. Start with distilled 35% H₂O₂. Re-distill in quartz still under clean nitrogen. Add chelating agents (EDTA) before distillation to remove trace metals. Distill at 60-70°C, 50 mbar. Collect middle 70% fraction. Test by ICP-MS: total metals <10 ppb. Individual metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Cr, Al) <1 ppb. Test particles: <10 particles/mL >0.1 µm. Filter through 0.02 µm PTFE membrane in ISO Class 5 cleanroom. Package in HDPE or PTFE bottles. Avoid glass (leaches sodium, boron). Rinse bottles with H₂O₂ before filling. Store under nitrogen blanket (exclude air - oxygen accelerates decomposition).

**Step 79-88: Packaging and Storage**
Package in HDPE (high-density polyethylene) bottles or drums. Carboys: 5-25 liters. Drums: 200 liters. Bulk: 1,000 liter IBC totes. Vented caps required - slow O₂ evolution pressurizes sealed containers (risk of explosion). Store at 15-25°C in ventilated area. Separate from flammables, combustibles, reducing agents, organic materials. Incompatible with: metals (especially iron, copper), acids (except phosphoric), bases, dirt, rust. Sunlight accelerates decomposition - store in opaque containers or dark room. Insulated storage for hot climates (>30°C accelerates decomposition). Label with concentration, production date, stabilizer type, hazard warnings (oxidizer, corrosive). Maximum storage: 6-12 months (loses 1-5% strength per year).

**Step 89-100: Applications and Safety**
Semiconductor cleaning: RCA SC-1 solution (NH₄OH:H₂O₂:H₂O = 1:1:5 or 1:2:10), 70-80°C, 10-15 minutes. Removes organic contaminants, particles. SC-2 solution (HCl:H₂O₂:H₂O = 1:1:5), 70-80°C. Removes metal ions. Piranha solution (H₂SO₄:H₂O₂ = 3:1), room temperature. Removes heavy organics, photoresist residues. Extremely exothermic when mixed - heat to 100-120°C. Safety: oxidizer - fires burn vigorously in presence of H₂O₂. Concentrated solutions (>50%) cause severe burns. Vapors irritate eyes, respiratory system. Wear gloves (neoprene or butyl rubber, NOT latex or nitrile - oxidized rapidly), face shield, apron. Spills: dilute with large volumes of water. H₂O₂ decomposes to water and oxygen - no toxic residue. Price: $1-2/kg for 35% industrial grade. $5-10/kg for 30% electronic grade (ultra-high purity). $10-20/kg for 70% grade.
