# How to Make Sulfuric Acid

**Top Market Leaders:**

Most produced chemical worldwide (250 million tons/year). H₂SO₄. Made via Contact Process.

## Contact Process:
1. Burn [Sulfur](elemental-sulfur) in [Oxygen](oxygen-gas): S + O₂ → SO₂ (sulfur dioxide)
2. Oxidize SO₂ to SO₃ with [Catalyst](vanadium-catalyst) (V₂O₅) at 450°C: 2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃
3. Absorb SO₃ in concentrated H₂SO₄: SO₃ + H₂SO₄ → H₂S₂O₇ (oleum)
4. Dilute with [Water](water-supply): H₂S₂O₇ + H₂O → 2H₂SO₄
5. Concentration: 93-98% (concentrated)

**Uses:** Fertilizer production (60%), chemical manufacturing, petroleum refining, metal processing, battery acid, semiconductor anodizing. Price: $50-150/ton depending on concentration and purity. Electronic-grade (99.999%): $500-1000/ton.
