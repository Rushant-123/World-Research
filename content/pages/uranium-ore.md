1. Roll-front uranium deposits in sandstone aquifers
2. Typical grade: 0.03-0.1% U3O8
3. In-situ leaching (ISL) method avoids surface mining
4. Exploration drilling on 50m grid spacing
5. Ore body delineation with geophysical logging
6. Well field pattern designed (injection and recovery wells)
7. Injection wells drilled on 20-40m spacing
8. Recovery wells in center of patterns
9. Monitor wells surround well field
10. Baseline groundwater quality established
11. Lixiviant prepared: sulfuric acid + oxidizer
12. Acid concentration: 1-5 g/L H2SO4
13. Oxidizer: hydrogen peroxide or oxygen
14. Injection at 100-200 liters per minute per well
15. Uranium dissolves: U4+ → U6+ in acidic oxidizing solution
16. Solution percolates through sandstone ore
17. Pregnant solution recovered from extraction wells
18. Uranium concentration: 20-200 mg/L
19. Ion exchange plant on surface
20. Strong-base anion resin captures uranyl ions
21. Resin eluted with chloride or sulfate solution
22. Uranium precipitated with hydrogen peroxide or ammonia
23. Yellow cake (U3O8) product filtered and dried
24. Purity: 70-90% U3O8
25. Packaged in 200-liter drums
26. Spent lixiviant treated and re-injected
27. Water balance maintained (no net extraction)
28. Monitor wells checked weekly for excursions
29. Well field restoration after depletion
30. Groundwater restoration with reducing agents
31. Post-mining monitoring for 5-10 years
32. Radiation monitoring of workers (dosimetry)
33. Radon gas monitoring in plant buildings
34. Production: 2,000-5,000 tons U3O8 per year
35. Low environmental footprint vs conventional mining
36. Automated process control and monitoring
