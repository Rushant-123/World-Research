# How to Make Photoresist

Light-sensitive chemical used in semiconductor photolithography. Coated on wafer, exposed through photomask, developed to create pattern. **Positive resist:** exposed areas dissolve. **Negative resist:** exposed areas harden.

## Composition:
[Polymer Resin](novolac-resin) (40-70%), [Photoactive Compound](pac-chemical) (10-30%), [Solvent](pgmea-solvent) (20-40%), [Additives](surfactants) (1-5%). Mix in [Chemical Mixer](chemical-mixer) under yellow light (resist sensitive to UV). Filter to remove particles. Bottle in clean containers.

**Types:** i-line (365nm), DUV (248nm, 193nm), EUV (13.5nm). Each requires different chemistry. EUV resist challenge: sensitivity vs resolution vs roughness trade-off. Cost: $500-2000/liter for advanced resists.
