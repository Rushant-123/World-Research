# How to Make CLI Software

**Market Leader:** [Anthropic](/companies/anthropic)



Command-line interface software runs in terminal, accepting text commands and displaying text output. Claude Code CLI is built with TypeScript, runs on Node.js, and provides AI-assisted coding through terminal commands.

## What is it?

Terminal application built with [TypeScript](typescript-language) and [Node.js Runtime](nodejs-runtime). Uses [NPM Packages](npm-dependencies) for functionality (HTTP client, terminal UI, file system). Developed by [Software Engineers](software-developers) at Anthropic. Source code in [GitHub Repository](github-repository). Distributed via npm (Node Package Manager).

## Development Process:
1. Engineers write code in TypeScript (typed superset of JavaScript)
2. Import dependencies: API client libraries, terminal UI frameworks, file watchers
3. Implement features: tool use, file editing, command execution, context management
4. Test locally on macOS, Linux, Windows
5. Build: TypeScript compiler generates JavaScript
6. Package as npm module
7. Publish to npm registry
8. Users install with: npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
9. Binary available in PATH as 'claude' command
10. Auto-update mechanism checks for new versions

Free and open-source. Integrates with: text editors, git, build tools, testing frameworks.
