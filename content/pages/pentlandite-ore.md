1. Pentlandite ((Fe,Ni)9S8) primary nickel mineral
2. Associated with pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite
3. Ore grade typically 0.5-2% nickel
4. Deep underground mining (500-1500m depth)
5. Shaft sinking through hard igneous rock
6. Development of main haulage level
7. Sublevel open stoping for massive sulfide
8. Longhole drilling from sublevels
9. Fan-pattern boreholes 25-40m long
10. Heavy ANFO explosive mix for hard rock
11. Large-scale blasting (20,000-50,000 tons)
12. Ore drawdown over several months
13. Remote-controlled ore passes
14. Underground truck haulage to shaft
15. Skip hoisting to surface facility
16. Primary jaw crushing to <200mm
17. Grinding in SAG and ball mill circuit
18. Target grind size: 75-100 microns
19. Bulk sulfide flotation using xanthates
20. Combined nickel-copper concentrate
21. Concentrate grade: 5-10% Ni, 2-4% Cu
22. Pentlandite liberation critical for recovery
23. Magnetic separation of pyrrhotite
24. Reduced concentrate mass to smelter
25. Thickening to 65-70% solids
26. Filtration achieves 9% moisture
27. Precious metals (Pt, Pd) credit in concentrate
28. Complete assay: Ni, Cu, Co, Pt, Pd, Au, Fe, S
29. Severe climate operations (-40°C winter)
30. Heated buildings and equipment shelters
31. Underground refuge chambers at 500m intervals
32. Seismic monitoring for rockbursts
33. Ground freezing for shaft stability
34. Workforce operates year-round shifts
35. Production rate: 3-5 million tons ore per year
36. Nickel recovery: 85-90% in concentrate
