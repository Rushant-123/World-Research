# How to Make Cardboard Box

A corrugated cardboard box is a shipping container made from kraft paper and a fluted middle layer. Used to package and protect products during transportation. The corrugated structure provides strength and cushioning while remaining lightweight and recyclable.

## What is it?

A rectangular container made from corrugated cardboard (3-5 layers). Typical laptop box: 16" × 12" × 4", single-wall corrugation (B-flute or C-flute), 32 ECT (Edge Crush Test) strength. Consists of: outer liner (kraft paper), fluted medium (wavy paper), inner liner. Printed with logos, product info, barcodes. Die-cut for fold lines and hand holes. Glued or stapled at corners. Stacking strength: 200-600 lbs. Weight: 200-400 grams. Cost: $0.50-$5 depending on size and quality. 95% recyclable. Annual global production: 300+ billion boxes.

## Steps to Make:

**Raw Material Preparation:**
1. Source [Kraft Paper](kraft-paper) for outer and inner liners
2. Kraft paper: strong brown paper made from wood pulp (pine, spruce, hardwoods)
3. Basis weight: 26-42 lbs per 1,000 square feet (127-205 g/m²)
4. Virgin kraft: 100% new wood pulp, strongest
5. Recycled kraft: 80-100% recycled content, slightly weaker but eco-friendly
6. Source [Corrugating Medium](corrugating-paper) for fluted middle layer
7. Medium weight: 23-26 lbs per 1,000 square feet (lighter than liner)
8. Medium properties: must flute well without cracking
9. Receive paper in large rolls: 8-10 feet wide, 3,000-6,000 lbs per roll

**Corrugator Machine Setup:**
10. Install paper rolls on corrugator machine: 3-5 rolls depending on board type
11. Single-wall corrugator: 3 rolls (liner, medium, liner)
12. Double-wall corrugator: 5 rolls (liner, medium, liner, medium, liner)
13. Roll stand: holds heavy paper rolls, enables continuous feeding
14. Splicer: automatically joins rolls when previous roll runs out
15. Pre-conditioner: steam chest heats paper to 170-200°F
16. Purpose: soften paper fibers, make medium pliable for fluting
17. Moisture adjustment: spray water if paper too dry (<6% moisture)

**Corrugating Process:**
18. Feed corrugating medium between corrugating rolls
19. Corrugating rolls: two large gears with sine-wave profiles
20. Roll diameter: 12-18 inches with 90-112 flutes per foot
21. Heat rolls: steam-heated to 350-375°F
22. Medium pressed between rolls: forms continuous wavy flutes
23. Flute profiles: A-flute (5mm tall), B-flute (3mm), C-flute (4mm), E-flute (1.5mm)
24. B-flute common for laptop boxes: good stacking strength, less cushioning
25. C-flute common for general shipping: balanced strength and cushioning

**Gluing First Liner:**
26. Apply [Cornstarch Adhesive](starch-glue) to flute tips
27. Single facer glue: gelatinized starch (heated corn starch and water)
28. Glue temperature: 125-150°F for proper tack
29. Glue roll: transfers thin film of glue to flute peaks
30. Glue application: only on one side of flutes (tips)
31. First liner pressed onto glued flute tips
32. Pressure rolls: apply 50-200 PSI to bond liner to medium
33. Result: single-face board (one flat liner, fluted medium exposed on other side)

**Bridging and Drying:**
34. Single-face board travels on bridge conveyor
35. Bridge: elevated conveyor 50-100 feet long
36. Purpose: allow glue to set while staying flat (no warping)
37. Travel time: 30-60 seconds on bridge
38. Temperature: ambient air cools board, sets starch adhesive
39. Tension control: prevent over-stretching or buckling
40. Single-face storage: large rolls or festoon (zigzag stack) if making double-wall

**Double-Backer (Adding Second Liner):**
41. Feed single-face board into double-backer section
42. Apply glue to exposed flute tips (other side of medium)
43. Glue machine: rotary glue applicator with starch adhesive
44. Second liner pressed onto glued flute tips
45. Hot plate section: heats board to 300-350°F
46. Hot plates: steam-heated metal plates, board travels over them
47. Purpose: gelatinize starch glue, create strong bond
48. Pressure: rollers apply 100-300 PSI during heating
49. Result: double-face board (liner-medium-liner sandwich)

**Cooling and Conditioning:**
50. Exit hot plates: board temperature 250-300°F
51. Cooling section: forced air or natural cooling
52. Cool to <120°F before slitting and cutting
53. Moisture equilibration: board adjusts to room humidity
54. Target moisture: 8-10% for dimensional stability

75. Doctor blade: scrapes excess ink, ensures uniform film thickness

**Printing Process:**
76. Feed corrugated sheets into printer feed unit
77. Registration pins: align sheet precisely (±1mm)
78. Ink transfer: anilox roll → printing plate → cardboard
79. Print pressure: 50-100 PSI between plate cylinder and impression cylinder
80. Print speed: 300-500 feet per minute for corrugated board
81. Drying: hot air dryers evaporate water or solvents
82. Dryer temperature: 200-300°F depending on ink type

Corrugated cardboard boxes are the workhorses of global logistics - lightweight, strong, recyclable, and inexpensive. A typical corrugator produces 500,000+ boxes per day, using 3-5 tons of paper per hour. The corrugated structure, invented in 1856, provides 100× the strength of flat paper at only 3× the weight. Modern corrugated board can support 600 lbs in compression while weighing only 400 grams, enabling efficient shipping of everything from feathers to refrigerators.
