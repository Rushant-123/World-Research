## Flexographic Printing Ink Manufacturing Process

### Raw Material Receiving and Quality Control

1. Receive pigment shipment (carbon black, phthalocyanine blue, yellow iron oxide) in 25 kg fiber drums, verify COA showing particle size <0.5 μm, oil absorption 80-120 mL/100g, tinting strength 95-105%
2. Inspect resin binder delivery (acrylic polymer, polyamide resin, nitrocellulose) in 200 kg drums, check viscosity 400-800 cPs at 25°C, acid value <10 mg KOH/g, molecular weight 20,000-50,000 Da
3. Test solvent purity (ethanol, ethyl acetate, n-propanol, water) via gas chromatography, confirm >99.5% purity, water content <0.1%, boiling point range within ±2°C of specification
4. Verify additive shipments (wetting agents, defoamers, waxes, driers) checking density ±0.01 g/cm³, pH within ±0.3 units, active content ±2% of specification
5. Sample incoming pigments for particle size distribution using laser diffraction, verify D50 0.1-0.3 μm, D90 <1.0 μm, no aggregates >5 μm
6. Measure resin solution properties: prepare 50% solution in appropriate solvent, check clarity (no haze), compatibility (no precipitation after 24 hours), and color (Gardner <3)
7. Test solvent evaporation rate relative to n-butyl acetate (=100), verify ethanol ~5.5, ethyl acetate ~3.8, n-propanol ~2.8 for proper drying characteristics
8. Analyze pigment oil absorption by rubbing out method, confirm consistency batch-to-batch within ±5%, affecting required resin ratio
9. Check resin glass transition temperature (Tg) via DSC, verify 15-35°C for water-based inks, 40-80°C for solvent-based inks affecting film flexibility
10. Verify additive functionality: test wetting agent surface tension reduction (to 25-30 mN/m), defoamer effectiveness (foam height <5 mm after 30 seconds)
11. Inspect packaging materials integrity: drums undamaged, seals intact, no contamination, proper labeling with batch numbers and expiration dates
12. Store pigments in climate-controlled warehouse at 18-25°C, <60% relative humidity, protect from direct sunlight to prevent degradation
13. Maintain resin storage at 15-30°C, ensure proper ventilation for solvent-based materials, rotate stock using FIFO system
14. Store solvents in explosion-proof room with temperature control (<30°C), grounding systems, proper ventilation (>10 air changes/hour), and spill containment
15. Document all incoming materials in batch tracking system with unique identifiers, link to final product for full traceability

### Pigment Dispersion - Pre-mixing Phase

16. Weigh pigment according to formula (typically 15-25% of total ink weight for process colors, up to 40% for whites), accuracy ±0.1%
17. Pre-disperse pigment with portion of resin binder (30-50% of total resin) in high-speed disperser at 1,000-1,500 rpm for 15-20 minutes
18. Add wetting agent (0.5-2% of pigment weight) to reduce surface tension and improve pigment wetting, monitor temperature rise to <50°C
19. Check pre-mix viscosity with Brookfield viscometer at 60 rpm, target 3,000-8,000 cPs ensuring adequate fluidity for mill feeding
20. Measure pre-mix particle size using Hegman gauge, achieve fineness 3-5 Hegman units (15-30 μm largest particles) before milling
21. Adjust pre-mix composition if needed: add more resin if too thick, more pigment if insufficient loading, re-disperse for 5-10 minutes
22. Transfer pre-mix to holding tank with gentle agitation (50-100 rpm) to prevent settling, maintain temperature 20-30°C
23. Clean disperser immediately with appropriate solvent, inspect blades for wear (replace if <80% original sharpness)

### Ball Mill Dispersion

24. Prepare ball mill (horizontal or attritor type, 50-500 L capacity) by inspecting grinding media (ceramic, steel, or glass beads 1-3 mm diameter)
25. Verify grinding media fill: 50-60% of mill volume for optimal efficiency, check for broken or worn media (replace if >10% damaged)
26. Load pre-mixed pigment/resin slurry into mill through feed port, fill to 30-40% of remaining volume allowing space for media movement
27. Add additional solvent if needed to achieve optimal mill base viscosity 500-2,000 cPs for efficient grinding
28. Seal mill and begin rotation at 50-80% critical speed (speed where media centrifuges to wall), typically 30-60 rpm for horizontal mills
29. Monitor mill temperature via external sensors, maintain 30-45°C using cooling jacket (water flow 5-10 L/min at 15-20°C inlet)
30. Run mill for 2-6 hours depending on pigment difficulty (organic pigments 2-4 hours, inorganic pigments 4-6 hours)
31. Sample mill base every 30-60 minutes, check particle size on Hegman gauge targeting 7-8 Hegman units (<5 μm largest particles)
32. Measure color strength by drawing down sample at standardized thickness (25 μm wet), compare to standard using spectrophotometer
33. Check gloss development by applying sample to standard substrate, cure, and measure 60° gloss (target >70 for high-gloss inks)
34. Monitor power consumption of mill motor, stable reading indicates grinding complete (no further particle size reduction)
35. Once target fineness achieved, discharge mill base into receiving tank with 100 μm filter screen to catch any large particles or foreign matter
36. Rinse mill with small amount of solvent to recover remaining material, add to main batch
37. Clean ball mill thoroughly: flush with solvent, drain, dry with warm air, inspect media for wear and contamination
38. Record mill run parameters: pigment type, batch size, milling time, final fineness, power consumption for process optimization

41. Prime mill by circulating solvent through system, check all seals, flow meters, and pressure gauges for proper operation
42. Start circulation pump and gradually increase flow rate to 5-15 L/min depending on mill size and product viscosity
43. Adjust separator screen gap (typically 2-3× bead diameter) to retain media while allowing product passage
44. Begin feeding pre-mixed slurry at controlled rate (1-5 L/min for 10 L mill), monitor inlet and outlet particle size
45. Set mill tip speed to 8-12 m/s (calculated from rotor diameter and rpm), higher speeds for difficult dispersions
46. Monitor energy input (specific energy 5-20 kWh/kg for typical flexo inks), correlates with dispersion quality
47. Control temperature using heat exchanger, maintain mill chamber at 35-50°C to balance dispersion efficiency and stability
48. Operate in recirculation mode initially: collect output and refeed until target fineness reached (typically 3-5 passes)

51. Check dispersion stability by centrifuge test: centrifuge sample at 3,000 rpm for 30 minutes, observe for settling or floating
52. Once specification met, switch to single-pass mode, collect finished mill base in clean receiving vessel
53. Adjust feed rate to match production speed while maintaining quality, typical throughput 10-100 L/hr depending on mill size
54. Monitor pressure differential across separator, increasing pressure indicates screen blockage (clean if >2 bar above normal)
55. Sample final mill base for complete quality testing: fineness, viscosity, color strength, transparency, and compatibility
