Manufacturing copper powder begins with raw material preparation. High-purity copper metal ingots (99.9% Cu minimum) arrive at the facility for processing. Ingots are inspected for surface defects, oxidation, and contamination. Chemical analysis confirms copper purity, trace element content, and oxygen levels. Each batch receives unique identification for traceability throughout production. Ingots are cleaned using mechanical brushing to remove surface oxides. Ultrasonic cleaning in alkaline solution removes organic contaminants. Acid pickling in dilute sulfuric acid (5-10% concentration) removes remaining oxides. Ingots are rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. Final drying occurs in heated air cabinets at 80-100°C. Clean ingots are staged near melting furnaces for immediate processing.

Water atomization process begins with furnace preparation. Induction melting furnace is preheated to 200°C to remove moisture. Copper ingots are loaded into graphite crucibles lined with ceramic wash. Furnace atmosphere is purged with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation. Heating commences at controlled rate of 100°C per minute. Copper melts at approximately 1085°C as furnace reaches 1200-1250°C. Molten copper is held at temperature for 15-20 minutes for homogenization. Dross and surface impurities are skimmed from melt surface. Melt temperature is monitored continuously with thermocouples. Degassing treatment removes dissolved gases using argon bubbling. Melt is stirred gently to ensure uniform temperature distribution.

Water atomization system is prepared simultaneously. High-pressure water pumps are activated and pressure set to 80-150 bar. Water is filtered through 5-micron filters to remove particulates. Water temperature is controlled at 15-25°C for optimal atomization. Atomization nozzles are inspected for wear and proper alignment. Spray pattern is tested before production begins. Atomization chamber is evacuated and purged with nitrogen. Chamber pressure is reduced to slight vacuum (0.8-0.9 bar absolute). Collection system and water circulation are verified operational. Safety interlocks confirm all systems ready for atomization.

Molten copper is transferred to tundish with stopper rod control. Tundish maintains metal temperature at 1200-1220°C. Stopper rod opens allowing metal stream to flow through nozzle. Metal stream diameter is typically 6-10 mm. High-pressure water jets impact molten stream from multiple angles. Water jets fragment molten copper into fine droplets. Droplets solidify rapidly during flight through atomization chamber. Cooling rate reaches 1000-10,000°C per second. Solidified particles fall into water collection tank below. Water quenching ensures complete solidification and cooling.

Particle collection system captures copper powder slurry. Slurry contains 15-25% solids by weight. Copper particles settle in primary collection tank. Overflow water is recycled through filtration system. Settled powder is transferred to dewatering equipment. Vacuum filters remove bulk water reducing moisture to 30-40%. Filter cakes are broken up and transferred to drying equipment. Rotary dryers operate at 120-150°C with nitrogen atmosphere. Drying time is 2-4 hours depending on batch size. Exit moisture content is reduced below 0.1%. Dried powder is cooled to room temperature in nitrogen atmosphere.

Gas atomization process offers alternative production method. Copper is melted in induction furnace as in water atomization. Melt superheat is controlled at 100-150°C above melting point. Atomization chamber is evacuated to high vacuum (0.01-0.1 mbar). Inert gas (nitrogen or argon) is introduced at controlled pressure. Gas pressure at nozzle is 20-50 bar depending on desired particle size. Molten copper flows through ceramic delivery tube. Metal emerges from nozzle at 1150-1200°C. High-velocity gas jets impact and atomize metal stream. Gas velocity reaches 200-400 m/s at nozzle exit.

Atomization nozzle design critically affects particle characteristics. Close-coupled nozzle places gas jets immediately below metal stream. Free-fall nozzle allows metal to fall before gas impact. Confined nozzle atomizes within restricted chamber. Gas flow rate is 50-200 Nm³/hour per kg of metal. Multiple gas jets (typically 4-8) ensure uniform atomization. Jet angle relative to metal stream is 20-45 degrees. Atomization efficiency increases with gas-to-metal ratio. Higher gas pressure produces finer particle sizes. Gas temperature is preheated to 200-400°C to prevent premature solidification.

Solidified particles are collected in chamber bottom. Cyclone separators capture fine particles from exhaust gas. Gas is filtered and recycled to reduce consumption. Collection chamber operates under inert atmosphere throughout. Powder accumulates in collection hoppers with level monitoring. Batch collection typically processes 50-500 kg per run. Temperature in collection zone is maintained at 40-60°C. Powder is cooled before exposure to air. Transfer to storage containers occurs in nitrogen atmosphere. Gas-atomized powder has spherical morphology with low oxygen content.

Electrolytic copper powder production uses different approach. Copper anodes (99.9% purity) are suspended in electrolyte. Cathodes are titanium or stainless steel plates or drums. Electrolyte is copper sulfate solution (100-200 g/L Cu). Sulfuric acid concentration is 50-100 g/L for conductivity. Temperature is maintained at 35-55°C with cooling coils. Current density is high at 300-800 A/m² for powder formation. Low current density produces coherent deposits while high produces powder. Voltage is 0.3-0.8 V between anode and cathode. Additives control particle morphology and prevent agglomeration.

Copper dissolves from anode and deposits on cathode. At high current density, dendritic copper grows on cathode. Dendrites become fragile and detach forming powder particles. Mechanical agitation or ultrasonic vibration assists powder release. Powder falls to bottom of electrolytic cell. Collection occurs continuously or periodically during operation. Cell operates for 6-24 hours per production cycle. Electrolyte is filtered continuously to remove powder particles. Powder is separated from electrolyte using filtration. Filter press or vacuum filter dewaters powder slurry.

Electrolytic powder is washed to remove electrolyte residues. Multiple water washes reduce sulfate content below 0.05%. Washing occurs in agitated tanks with fresh water additions. Vacuum filtration removes wash water between stages. Final rinse uses deionized water for highest purity. Washed powder contains 40-50% moisture. Drying occurs in vacuum ovens at 60-100°C. Drying atmosphere is air or nitrogen depending on requirements. Drying time is 4-12 hours to reach below 0.1% moisture. Electrolytic powder has dendritic morphology with high surface area.

Particle size classification is critical for powder specifications. Dried powder is fed to air classification system. Vibratory feeder meters powder at controlled rate. Air classifier uses centrifugal and drag forces to separate particles. Rotating air flow creates classification zone. Fine particles are carried upward by air flow. Coarse particles fall downward under gravity. Classification cut point is adjustable from 5 to 150 microns. Multiple classifiers in series create several size fractions. Each fraction is collected in separate container.

Sieve classification provides precise size distribution control. Powder is fed onto top sieve of stack. Sieve stack contains 4-8 different mesh sizes. Common meshes include 325 mesh (45 μm), 200 mesh (75 μm), 100 mesh (150 μm). Vibrating or oscillating motion causes powder to pass through openings. Finer particles pass through while coarser are retained. Each sieve level collects specific size range. Sieving time is 10-30 minutes depending on powder and quantity. Oversize and undersize fractions are processed separately or recycled. Standard size grades include -325 mesh, -200+325 mesh, -100+200 mesh.

Oxide reduction improves powder purity and properties. Copper powder naturally contains surface oxides (CuO, Cu2O). Oxide content ranges from 0.2-2.0% depending on production method. Reduction furnace is loaded with powder in shallow trays. Tray depth is limited to 20-50 mm for gas penetration. Furnace is purged with nitrogen to remove air. Hydrogen gas is introduced at 5-20% concentration in nitrogen. Temperature is raised gradually at 50-100°C per hour. Reduction occurs at 200-400°C depending on oxide level.

Hydrogen reacts with copper oxides producing metallic copper and water. Reaction: CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. Lower temperature favors gradual, complete reduction. Higher temperature risks powder sintering and agglomeration. Holding time at peak temperature is 1-4 hours. Hydrogen flow rate maintains slight positive pressure (0.01-0.05 bar). Exhaust gases pass through moisture trap to remove water vapor. Dewpoint monitoring ensures complete oxide reduction. After reduction, furnace cools under hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere. Cooling rate is controlled at 50-100°C per hour to prevent reoxidation.

Powder is cooled to below 50°C before air exposure. Inert gas is maintained until complete cooling. Reduced powder has metallic luster and low oxygen content. Oxygen content after reduction is typically 0.05-0.3%. Some applications require oxygen below 0.1% for optimal performance. Ultra-high purity grades may have oxygen below 0.05%. Reduced powder is more reactive and requires careful handling. Packaging occurs immediately after cooling to prevent reoxidation. Transfer systems use nitrogen blanketing during handling.

Morphology control produces specific particle shapes. Spherical powder results from gas atomization with rapid cooling. Gas pressure, temperature, and flow rate control sphericity. Higher gas velocity produces more spherical particles. Longer flight distance allows complete spheroidization. Collection height of 4-8 meters provides sufficient cooling time. Spherical particles have smooth surfaces and high apparent density. Sphericity is measured as ratio of particle dimensions. High sphericity particles (>0.9) flow easily and pack densely.

Dendritic powder forms during electrolytic deposition. Current density, temperature, and additives control dendrite structure. Higher current density produces more branched dendrites. Additives like thiourea or gelatin modify dendrite growth. Temperature affects dendrite branch spacing and thickness. Dendritic particles have high surface area (0.5-2.0 m²/g). Complex morphology provides excellent green strength in compacts. Dendrites interlock mechanically during powder compaction. Applications include friction materials and electrical contacts.

Irregular powder results from water atomization. Particle shape is affected by cooling rate and turbulence. Water-atomized particles are often angular or potato-shaped. Surface may be smooth or have satellite particles attached. Irregular particles have lower apparent density than spherical. Packing density is 40-55% of theoretical density. Irregular shape provides mechanical interlocking during compaction. Green strength is higher than spherical powder compacts. Applications include sintered components and metal injection molding.

Apparent density measurement quantifies powder packing characteristics. Hall flowmeter funnel is standard apparatus. Funnel has specific dimensions and orifice size (2.5 mm). Powder sample (50 grams) is poured into funnel. Powder flows through orifice into density cup below. Density cup has precise volume (25 cm³) and smooth rim. Cup is filled and excess powder leveled with straightedge. Powder mass divided by cup volume gives apparent density. Typical copper powder apparent density ranges 1.5-4.5 g/cm³. Spherical powder has highest apparent density (3.5-4.5 g/cm³).

Water-atomized powder apparent density is 2.0-3.5 g/cm³. Electrolytic powder apparent density is 1.5-2.5 g/cm³. Low apparent density indicates irregular shape or dendritic structure. High apparent density indicates spherical particles and good packing. Tap density is measured after mechanical vibration. Sample in cylinder is tapped 3000 times at controlled rate. Tapping compacts powder increasing packing density. Tap density is 5-20% higher than apparent density. Hausner ratio (tap density/apparent density) indicates flowability. Low Hausner ratio (<1.25) indicates good flow characteristics.

Flow rate testing measures powder handling properties. Hall flowmeter is standard test apparatus. Funnel orifice diameter is 2.5 mm for standard test. Powder sample (50 grams) is placed in funnel with orifice closed. Orifice is opened and time for complete flow is recorded. Flow rate is reported as seconds per 50 grams. Free-flowing powders have flow time under 40 seconds. Moderately flowing powders range 40-100 seconds. Non-flowing powders do not flow through standard orifice. Larger orifice (5.0 mm) used for coarser or non-flowing powders.

Carney funnel provides alternative flow measurement. Carney funnel has larger orifice (5 mm) for coarser powders. Test procedure is similar to Hall flowmeter. Flow rate correlates with particle size, shape, and moisture. Finer powders flow more slowly due to higher friction. Spherical particles flow more easily than irregular shapes. Moisture content above 0.2% significantly impairs flow. Additives like stearic acid (0.1-0.5%) improve flowability. Flow aids reduce interparticle friction and adhesion. Good flow properties are essential for automated handling systems.

Compressibility testing evaluates powder behavior under pressure. Die compaction is performed in hardened steel tooling. Cylindrical die diameter is typically 10-25 mm. Powder sample (5-20 grams) fills die cavity. Upper punch applies controlled pressure to powder. Pressure ranges from 100 to 800 MPa (0.5-4 tons/in²). Compaction pressure is increased in steps (100, 200, 400, 600 MPa). Compact height is measured at each pressure level. Green density is calculated from compact mass and dimensions.

Compressibility is plotted as density versus pressure curve. Initial packing occurs below 100 MPa with particle rearrangement. Elastic and plastic deformation dominates at 100-400 MPa. Particle bonding and densification occur at 400-800 MPa. Good compressibility shows steep density increase with pressure. Maximum green density reaches 7.0-8.0 g/cm³ (80-90% theoretical). Dendritic powder compresses better than spherical due to particle deformation. Water-atomized irregular powder shows intermediate compressibility. Gas-atomized spherical powder requires highest pressure for equivalent density.

Green strength measures compact resistance to handling damage. Green compact is ejected from die after compaction. Radial crushing strength test applies lateral force to compact. Transverse rupture strength test applies three-point bending. Higher green strength allows handling without breakage. Dendritic powder provides highest green strength. Irregular particles interlock providing moderate green strength. Spherical particles offer lowest green strength requiring lubricants or binders. Typical green strength ranges 2-15 MPa depending on morphology.

Sintering behavior analysis predicts final component properties. Thermal analysis uses dilatometer to measure dimensional changes. Powder compact is heated while measuring length changes. Initial expansion occurs due to thermal expansion. Shrinkage begins at sintering onset temperature (typically 600-700°C). Maximum shrinkage rate occurs at 800-900°C for copper. Sintering is typically performed at 850-950°C in reducing atmosphere. Hydrogen or dissociated ammonia prevents oxidation during sintering. Holding time at peak temperature is 20-60 minutes. Longer times increase density and neck growth between particles.

Sintered density depends on green density and sintering conditions. Typical sintered density reaches 85-95% of theoretical (7.5-8.5 g/cm³). Higher green density produces higher sintered density. Finer powder sinters more rapidly due to higher surface area. Dendritic powder achieves highest sintered density. Spherical powder requires higher sintering temperature or longer time. Sintering atmosphere composition critically affects results. Hydrogen content should be 5-100% with balance nitrogen. Dewpoint must be below -40°C to prevent oxidation.

Microstructure examination reveals sintering quality. Metallographic samples are mounted and polished. Polishing sequence uses progressively finer abrasives to 1 micron. Etching with ferric chloride solution reveals grain structure. Optical microscopy shows pore morphology and distribution. Residual porosity appears as dark regions in microstructure. Pore size, shape, and connectivity affect properties. Isolated spherical pores indicate good sintering. Interconnected irregular pores indicate incomplete sintering. Grain size ranges 10-50 microns depending on conditions.

Mechanical property testing evaluates sintered performance. Tensile test specimens are machined from sintered compacts. Standard dog-bone geometry with 6 mm diameter gage section. Tensile strength of sintered copper ranges 150-300 MPa. Elongation ranges 5-25% depending on porosity. Hardness testing uses Rockwell B scale (HRB 40-70). Density strongly influences mechanical properties. Each 1% increase in density improves strength approximately 10%. Yield strength ranges 100-200 MPa. Elastic modulus is 60-100 GPa (reduced from solid copper 130 GPa).

Electrical conductivity is critical for electrical applications. Four-point probe method measures resistivity. Sintered copper conductivity ranges 60-95% IACS. Higher density produces higher conductivity. Residual porosity reduces conductivity proportionally. Oxygen content below 0.2% essential for high conductivity. Surface oxides are removed before conductivity measurement. Conductivity of 85-90% IACS typical for well-sintered powder metallurgy copper. Ultra-high purity powder achieves 90-95% IACS after sintering. Applications requiring high conductivity use low oxygen powder.

Thermal conductivity is important for heat management applications. Laser flash method measures thermal diffusivity. Thermal conductivity calculated from diffusivity, density, and specific heat. Sintered copper thermal conductivity ranges 200-350 W/m·K. Solid copper thermal conductivity is approximately 400 W/m·K. Porosity reduces thermal conductivity more than electrical conductivity. Pore morphology affects thermal path connectivity. Spherical isolated pores less detrimental than interconnected porosity. Heat pipe applications require conductivity above 300 W/m·K.

Particle size distribution analysis characterizes powder grades. Laser diffraction is standard analytical method. Sample preparation disperses powder in liquid medium. Ultrasonic agitation prevents particle agglomeration. Laser beam passes through suspension and scattering is measured. Scattering pattern analyzed to determine particle size distribution. Results reported as volume percentage versus particle diameter. Common parameters include D10, D50, D90 values. D50 (median) represents 50% passing size. D90 represents 90% passing size (coarse end).

Typical copper powder grades by particle size. Ultra-fine grade: D50 = 5-15 microns, used in conductive pastes. Fine grade: D50 = 15-45 microns, used in metal injection molding. Medium grade: D50 = 45-75 microns, used in powder metallurgy. Coarse grade: D50 = 75-150 microns, used in friction materials. Very coarse grade: D50 = 150-300 microns, used in thermal spraying. Narrow distributions (D90/D10 < 5) provide uniform properties. Wide distributions (D90/D10 > 10) improve packing density.

Surface area measurement quantifies reactive area. BET method uses nitrogen gas adsorption. Sample is degassed under vacuum at 120°C for 2 hours. Nitrogen adsorption isotherm measured at liquid nitrogen temperature. Multi-point BET analysis calculates specific surface area. Spherical gas-atomized powder: 0.05-0.2 m²/g. Irregular water-atomized powder: 0.2-0.5 m²/g. Dendritic electrolytic powder: 0.5-2.0 m²/g. Higher surface area increases sintering activity. Higher surface area also increases oxygen pickup during storage.

Chemical analysis verifies powder composition and purity. Copper content determined by titration or ICP-OES. Main copper content: 99.0-99.9% depending on grade. Oxygen content analyzed by inert gas fusion method. Typical oxygen: 0.1-0.8% for atomized powder. Typical oxygen: 0.05-0.2% after hydrogen reduction. Iron, lead, zinc analyzed as trace impurities. Each impurity typically below 0.01%. Total impurities below 0.5% for high-purity grades. Carbon and sulfur analyzed by combustion methods. Low carbon (<0.01%) important for electrical applications.

Oxide content specifically measured by hydrogen loss method. Sample is reduced in hydrogen at 400°C. Weight loss indicates oxygen removed as water vapor. Calculation gives oxide percentage in original powder. Fresh atomized powder: 0.2-0.8% oxide. Aged powder in air: 1.0-3.0% oxide. Reduced powder: 0.05-0.3% oxide. Surface oxide thickness estimated from oxygen content. Native oxide layer is 2-5 nm on fresh powder. Aged powder may have 10-50 nm oxide layer.

Powder passivation prevents excessive oxidation during storage. Controlled oxidation creates thin protective oxide layer. Powder is exposed to dilute oxygen (0.5-2% in nitrogen). Treatment temperature is 50-120°C for 1-4 hours. Thin oxide layer (5-10 nm) forms on particle surface. Passivation reduces subsequent oxidation rate by factor of 5-10. Passivated powder remains stable during months of storage. Excessively thick oxide impairs sintering behavior. Balance between stability and sinterability is optimized. Alternative passivation uses organic coatings (stearic acid, oleic acid).

Quality control testing occurs throughout production. Raw material inspection verifies copper purity and cleanliness. In-process monitoring tracks atomization parameters and yields. Particle size testing ensures product meets specifications. Apparent density and flow rate measured on each batch. Moisture content verified below 0.1% after drying. Chemical analysis confirms copper content and impurity levels. Oxygen content measured to verify reduction effectiveness. Sample compaction and sintering tests validate performance. Statistical process control tracks trends and variability.

Packaging protects powder from contamination and oxidation. Powder is transferred to packaging area under nitrogen atmosphere. Polyethylene bags are used for inner packaging layer. Bags are heat-sealed after filling to exclude air. Nitrogen flushing displaces air before final seal. Metallized barrier films provide superior moisture protection. Outer packaging uses fiber drums or steel pails. Package sizes range from 5 kg to 200 kg. Labels indicate grade, lot number, and date of manufacture. Technical data sheet accompanies each shipment.

Storage conditions maintain powder quality. Warehouse temperature controlled at 15-25°C. Relative humidity maintained below 50% to prevent moisture absorption. Packages stored on pallets away from floor moisture. First-in-first-out rotation ensures fresh material usage. Shelf life is 12 months for non-reduced powder. Reduced powder shelf life is 6 months due to higher reactivity. Vacuum-packaged powder has extended shelf life of 24 months. Periodic testing verifies powder properties during storage. Reoxidation monitored by oxygen content measurement.

Shipping preparation ensures powder arrives in good condition. Packages are inspected for seal integrity before shipping. Palletizing and stretch wrapping secures packages during transport. Hazard classification: copper powder is not DOT regulated. However, fine powder (<150 micron) may be classified as combustible. Shipping documents include material safety data sheet. International shipments include customs documentation. Technical specifications and test certificates accompany shipment. Express shipping available for urgent orders. Standard lead time is 2-4 weeks for production orders.

Applications guide powder grade selection. Sintered heat pipes require high-purity spherical powder (D50 = 50-100 μm). Thermal interface materials use fine spherical powder (D50 = 5-20 μm). Conductive adhesives and pastes use ultra-fine powder (D50 = 1-10 μm). Powder metallurgy structural parts use irregular powder (D50 = 30-75 μm). Metal injection molding uses fine spherical powder (D50 = 10-30 μm). Diamond tool matrices use coarse irregular powder (D50 = 75-150 μm). Friction materials use dendritic powder for high green strength. Each application requires specific particle size, morphology, and purity.
