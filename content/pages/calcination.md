1. Calcination removes volatile components by heating
2. Common applications: limestone, alumina, kaolin
3. Rotary kiln most common equipment
4. Kiln shell: steel cylinder 3-6m diameter, 60-100m long
5. Refractory lining protects shell
6. Kiln incline: 2-4 degrees
7. Rotation speed: 0.5-2 RPM
8. Material fed at upper end
9. Residence time: 30-90 minutes
10. Kiln heated by burner at discharge end
11. Fuels: natural gas, coal, oil, or waste fuels
12. Flame temperature: 1,400-2,000°C
13. Counter-current flow: hot gas meets feed
14. Limestone calcination: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
15. Decomposition temperature: 900-1,000°C
16. Alumina calcination: Al(OH)3 → Al2O3 + H2O
17. Calcination temperature: 1,100-1,200°C
18. Product temperature: 900-1,300°C at discharge
19. Hot product enters rotary cooler
20. Cooling air recovers heat for combustion
21. Cooled product: 100-200°C
22. Product storage in silos
23. Exhaust gas treatment
24. Cyclones remove dust
25. Baghouse filter for fine particulate
26. CO2 emission significant (limestone calcination)
27. Kiln drive: motor and gearbox
28. Riding rings support shell on rollers
29. Thrust rollers control axial movement
30. Kiln alignment critical
31. Temperature monitoring along length
32. Infrared scanners detect hot spots
33. Shell hot spot indicates refractory failure
34. Refractory maintenance during shutdowns
35. Typical reline interval: 1-3 years
36. Fuel consumption: 1,000-1,500 kcal per kg product
37. Production rate: 100-1,000 tons per day per kiln
38. Energy efficiency: 60-70%
39. Process control optimizes fuel use
40. Product quality: reactivity, surface area, residual volatiles
