1. Blast pattern designed by engineers
2. Hole spacing: 5-12 meters
3. Hole diameter: 100-380mm
4. Drill rig positions at first hole location
5. GPS guidance ensures accurate placement
6. Drill bit: tricone or DTH (down-the-hole) hammer
7. Drilling fluid: air, water, or foam
8. Penetration rate: 15-50 meters per hour
9. Hole depth: 12-18 meters (bench height + subdrill)
10. Subdrill: 20-30% of bench height
11. Drill cuttings indicate rock type
12. Hole surveyed for deviation
13. Maximum deviation: 2-3% of depth
14. Collar protection prevents erosion
15. Explosive loading begins after drilling
16. Bottom priming with booster
17. Column charge: ANFO or emulsion
18. Stemming: crushed rock or drill cuttings
19. Stemming length: 0.7x burden
20. Detonator tied to downline
21. Electronic detonators programmed
22. Delay timing: 8-100 milliseconds
23. Blast area evacuated and secured
24. Shot firer initiates blast from safe distance
25. Blast fragmentation: 80% < 500mm
26. Throw distance controlled by timing
27. Muckpile shape affects loading efficiency
28. Post-blast inspection for misfires
29. Fumes cleared before equipment entry
30. Bench cleanup and scaling
31. Survey confirms blast results
32. Powder factor: 0.3-1.0 kg explosive per m³ rock
33. Vibration monitoring protects nearby structures
34. Flyrock control through blast design
35. Continuous improvement of patterns
