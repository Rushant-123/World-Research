# Enriched Uranium

**Market Leader:** [Orano](/companies/orano)



## Step 1: Mine uranium ore
Extract uranium-bearing ore from underground or open-pit mines containing 0.1-0.3% uranium oxide.

## Step 2: Crush uranium ore
Use mechanical crushers to break ore into smaller particles for chemical processing.

## Step 3: Leach uranium from ore
Dissolve uranium from crushed ore using sulfuric acid or alkaline solutions in large tanks.

## Step 4: Precipitate uranium concentrate
Add chemicals to precipitate uranium as yellowcake (U3O8) containing 70-90% uranium oxide.

## Step 5: Dry yellowcake concentrate
Remove water from uranium precipitate in rotary dryers producing powdered yellowcake.

## Step 195: Enable nuclear electricity generation
Provide enriched uranium fuel enabling carbon-free baseload electricity production from nuclear fission.
