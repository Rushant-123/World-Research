## Impact on Technology Ecosystem

Technical standards organizations enable the interoperability that makes the global internet possible. By providing open, consensus-based processes for developing specifications, these organizations ensure that diverse implementations can work together seamlessly. The RFC system at IETF, the W3C recommendation process, and ISO standards development all follow principles of openness, transparency, and rough consensus that have proven effective over decades. Standards cover everything from low-level network protocols to high-level application interfaces, creating the foundation for innovation and competition in technology markets.
