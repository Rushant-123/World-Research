Essential industrial chemical - fourth most produced chemical globally after sulfuric acid, nitrogen, and oxygen. Uses: PVC production (35% of demand), organic chemicals (EDC, phosgene, chloromethanes, 25%), water treatment and bleaching (pulp/paper, municipal, 20%), inorganic chemicals (titanium dioxide, aluminum chloride, 10%), other 10%. Global production: 70 million tonnes/year (2023). Chlor-alkali process: electrolysis of salt brine, co-produces caustic soda (NaOH) and hydrogen gas. Chlorine dictates production rates - caustic/hydrogen are co-products or byproducts depending on market demand.

**Step 1-18: [Salt Brine](salt-mining) Feedstock Preparation**
Raw material: sodium chloride (NaCl, table salt). Sources: rock salt mining (60%, underground halite deposits Michigan, Kansas, Texas, Louisiana, Germany, Poland, China), solar salt (30%, seawater evaporation Mediterranean, Middle East, Australia, Mexico), vacuum salt (10%, solution mining, highest purity >99.8%). **Brine saturation:** Dissolve rock salt in water (saturator vessels, 5-20m diameter, 8-12m tall, carbon steel construction). Fresh water + recycled depleted brine from electrolysis circulates through salt bed. Saturated brine: 310-320 g NaCl/L at 20°C (26-27% concentration, near solubility limit 360 g/L at 25°C). Temperature: 20-30°C (balance solubility vs energy cost, higher temp 60-80°C achieves 390 g/L but requires heating). Residence time: 2-6 hours, continuous flow 50-500 m³/h depending on plant capacity. **Clarification:** Gravity settling removes insoluble impurities (sand, clay, iron oxides, gypsum, organics). Thickener tanks 10-40m diameter, 1-24 hours retention. Flocculants: polyacrylamide (5-20 ppm, anionic or nonionic) agglomerate fine particles (<10 µm → 1-5 mm flocs). Overflow: clear brine 315 g/L NaCl, <100 ppm suspended solids. Underflow: sludge 20-40% solids to waste or salt recovery.

**Step 19-42: Critical Brine Purification for Membrane Cells**
Impurity removal essential - divalent cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺) poison ion-exchange membranes, cause scaling on anodes, reduce current efficiency. Specification: <0.02 ppm Ca, <0.01 ppm Mg, <0.1 ppm Fe, <0.005 ppm heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Cr). **Chemical precipitation:** Add sodium hydroxide (8-12 g/L NaOH, recycled from cathode product) + sodium carbonate (3-6 g/L Na₂CO₃, soda ash). Reactions: Ca²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CaCO₃ ↓ (calcium carbonate precipitate, solubility product Ksp 3.4×10⁻⁹ at 25°C, virtually complete precipitation at pH >11). Mg²⁺ + 2OH⁻ → Mg(OH)₂ ↓ (magnesium hydroxide, brucite, Ksp 5.6×10⁻¹², white gelatinous precipitate). Sr²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → SrCO₃ ↓ (strontium carbonate). Ba²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ → BaSO₄ ↓ (barium sulfate, if sulfate present). **Reaction tanks:** 10-30 min residence, 40-60°C, agitation 50-100 rpm (gentle, form large flocs without shear). Add polymer flocculant (0.5-2 ppm) for better settling. **Clarification:** Inclined plate settlers or lamella clarifiers (20-50m diameter, hydraulic loading 1-3 m³/m²·h), 2-4 hours retention. Flocs settle, sludge 10-20% solids removed continuously. **Filtration:** Multi-layer pressure sand filters (quartz sand 0.5-2mm + anthracite 1-3mm, bed depth 1.5-2.5m, flow rate 10-20 m³/h per m² filter area) or cartridge filters (5-10 µm polypropylene, polishing step). Backwash every 12-48 hours (reverse flow 30-50 m³/h removes accumulated solids, 10-20 min duration). **Ion exchange polishing (optional, high-spec plants):** Chelating resin beds (iminodiacetate functional groups) remove final traces Ca/Mg to <5 ppb. Regenerate with HCl or NaCl solution. **pH adjustment:** Lower to 9.5-10.5 with HCl if excess caustic (high pH >11 damages Nafion membranes, accelerates degradation, reduces 10,000+ hour lifetime to 2,000-5,000 hours). Final purified brine: 310-320 g/L NaCl, pH 10, <0.02 ppm Ca+Mg, clear, ready for electrolysis.

**Step 43-72: Chlor-Alkali Electrolysis - [Membrane Cell](membrane-cell) Technology**
Electrochemical reaction: 2NaCl + 2H₂O → Cl₂ + H₂ + 2NaOH (DC electric current drives non-spontaneous reaction, standard potential -2.19V, actual 2.8-3.5V with overpotentials). **Cell design:** Membrane cell technology (70-75% of global capacity, modern standard, replaced diaphragm 1990s-2010s, mercury cells banned). Electrolyzer: 50-200 individual cells stacked in series (bipolar configuration, metal partition plate acts as anode one side/cathode reverse, monopolar alternative has separate electrodes). Total current: 100-400 kA (kiloamperes, massive DC power requirement). **[Ion-exchange membrane](nafion-membrane):** Separates anode and cathode compartments. Material: perfluorosulfonic acid polymer (Nafion DuPont, Aciplex Asahi Glass, Flemion Asahi Glass, Gore-Tex membrane). Structure: fluoropolymer backbone (PTFE-like, chemically inert) + pendant sulfonate side chains (–CF₂–CF(OCF₂CF(CF₃)O–)n–(CF₂)m–SO₃⁻Na⁺). Thickness: 50-250 µm (thinner = lower resistance/voltage but less durable). Function: selectively transports Na⁺ cations (positive ions attracted through sulfonate channels), blocks Cl⁻ and OH⁻ anions (electrostatic repulsion), prevents mixing of chlorine and caustic (safety - Cl₂ + NaOH → NaOCl hypochlorite + heat, explosive at high concentration). Membrane lifetime: 5-10 years (gradual degradation from oxidative attack by Cl₂/O₂, mechanical stress, fouling by Ca/Mg precipitates if brine impure). Replacement cost: $500-2,000/m² membrane, $1-5M per electrolyzer.

**Step 73-95: Anode Compartment - Chlorine Generation**
**Anode:** [Dimensionally stable anode](dimensionally-stable-anode) (DSA, revolutionary 1960s invention by Henri Beer, replaced consumable graphite). Construction: titanium substrate (plate or mesh, 2-5mm thick, 1-3m² area per cell) + mixed metal oxide coating (2-10 µm thick). Coating composition: RuO₂ (ruthenium dioxide, 30-40%, active catalyst) + TiO₂ (titanium dioxide, 50-60%, stabilizer, conductive) or IrO₂-Ta₂O₅ (iridium-tantalum oxides, alternative, more stable but expensive). Application: thermal decomposition (dissolve metal chlorides in HCl/alcohol, brush or spray on Ti substrate, bake at 400-500°C, repeat 5-15 coats). **Anode reaction:** 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻ (oxidation, chloride ions lose electrons, form chlorine gas, E° = +1.36V vs SHE). Side reactions: 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ (oxygen evolution, competes with chlorine, <3% current efficiency loss, minimized by catalyst selectivity). Cl₂ + H₂O → HOCl + HCl (chlorine hydrolysis, reversed by acidic conditions). **Operating conditions:** Feed purified brine continuously to anode chamber (310 g/L NaCl input), exit depleted brine (200-220 g/L NaCl, 80-100 g/L consumed per pass, recycle to saturators for makeup). Temperature: 85-95°C (optimal ionic conductivity, membrane performance, reaction kinetics - balance between higher temp favoring kinetics vs membrane degradation >95°C). Current density: 2-6 kA/m² anode area (higher density = smaller/cheaper cells but higher voltage/energy consumption, typical 3-4 kA/m²). pH: acidic from anode reaction (H⁺ generated), pH 2-4 in anode liquor. **Chlorine gas evolution:** Bubbles form on anode surface (nucleate at 1-10 µm sites), grow to 0.5-3 mm, detach, rise through brine (gas holdup 10-30% volume fraction in brine above anode). Chlorine exits anode compartment: wet gas, saturated with water vapor at 85-90°C (45-55 kPa H₂O partial pressure), 99.5-99.8% Cl₂ (dry basis), 0.1-0.3% O₂, <0.1% H₂, traces CO₂/N₂ (from brine dissolved gases). Flow rate: 0.395 kg Cl₂ per kg NaOH stoichiometric (electrochemical equivalents, 2:2:1 molar ratio NaOH:Cl₂:H₂, mass ratio 1:0.886:0.025). Production: 1,000 tonne/day plant → 886 tonnes/day Cl₂, 25 tonnes/day H₂.

**Step 96-118: Cathode Compartment - Caustic and Hydrogen Co-Production**
**Cathode:** Nickel or nickel-coated steel (mesh, perforated plate, or porous structure, 1-3m² area). Nickel catalyzes hydrogen evolution, resistant to caustic corrosion. Activated nickel (Raney nickel coating, high surface area) reduces overpotential. Alternative: nickel-molybdenum alloys, platinum-coated titanium (expensive, high-performance). **Cathode reaction:** 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻ (reduction, water molecules gain electrons, split into hydrogen gas + hydroxide ions, E° = -0.83V vs SHE). Sodium ions (Na⁺) transported through membrane from anode (driven by electric field, concentration gradient, charge balance as Cl⁻ consumed at anode). Na⁺ + OH⁻ → NaOH (sodium hydroxide forms in cathode liquor). **Operating conditions:** Circulate dilute caustic solution through cathode (feed 30-33% NaOH, exit 32-35% NaOH, 2-3% concentration increase per pass, 10-20 passes through recycle loop). Temperature: 85-90°C (matched to anode, membrane optimal performance 80-95°C). Current density: same as anode, 2-6 kA/m². Flow rate: 5-15 m³/h per cell (high flow prevents concentration gradients, removes hydrogen bubbles). **Hydrogen gas evolution:** Bubbles form on cathode (smaller than chlorine, 0.1-1 mm diameter), gas holdup 5-15%. Exit gas: 99-99.5% H₂ (wet basis), 0.5-1% O₂ (permeates through membrane from anode, unwanted contamination), saturated with water vapor at 85-90°C. Hydrogen flow: 0.025 kg H₂ per kg NaOH (stoichiometric). **Caustic product:** 32-35% NaOH solution (320-350 g/L), pH 14, density 1.35-1.38 g/mL, viscosity 3-8 cP at 90°C. Purity: <100 ppm NaCl (membrane prevents back-diffusion, 100× better than diaphragm cell 1-2% NaCl), <1 ppm heavy metals, <50 ppm Na₂CO₃ (from atmospheric CO₂ absorption, minimized by nitrogen blanketing storage tanks). Caustic exits cathode compartment at 32-35%, concentrated to 50% in evaporators for commercial sale, or further to 98-99% for solid flake/prills.

**Step 119-142: Cell Voltage, Energy Consumption, and Efficiency**
**Thermodynamic potential:** Decomposition voltage 2.19V (calculated from standard electrode potentials, anode +1.36V + cathode -0.83V = 2.19V, minimum to drive reaction). **Overpotentials:** Additional voltage needed to overcome kinetic barriers. (1) Anode overpotential: 0.05-0.15V (depends on DSA coating, current density, O₂ evolution side reaction). (2) Cathode overpotential: 0.05-0.10V (H₂ evolution, nickel catalyst reduces this). (3) Membrane resistance: 0.15-0.50V (ion transport through polymer, depends on thickness, water content, temperature - thinner membranes lower voltage but shorter lifetime). (4) Solution resistance: 0.10-0.30V (ionic resistance in brine/caustic liquors, minimized by high conductivity, proper flow distribution, optimal concentration 310 g/L NaCl). (5) Bubble overpotential: 0.05-0.15V (gas bubbles block electrode surface, increase effective resistance). **Operating voltage:** 2.8-3.5V per cell (sum of 2.19V thermodynamic + 0.6-1.3V overpotentials). Modern efficient plants: 2.9-3.1V. Older plants: 3.2-3.8V. Voltage increases with: current density (higher → more overpotentials), membrane aging (degradation increases resistance), poor brine purification (scaling), temperature drop (lower conductivity). **Current efficiency:** 93-96% (percent of electrons that produce desired products Cl₂/NaOH vs side reactions). Losses: O₂ evolution at anode (2-5%), chlorate formation Cl₂ + 2OH⁻ → ClO⁻ + Cl⁻ + H₂O if chlorine/caustic mix (1-2%), back-diffusion of ions (<1%). **Energy consumption:** DC power: (Voltage × Current) / (Production rate). Typical: 2,000-2,500 kWh per tonne NaOH (or equivalently 2,250-2,800 kWh per tonne Cl₂ given 0.886 kg Cl₂ per kg NaOH). Best modern plants: 1,950-2,100 kWh/tonne NaOH. Older diaphragm cells: 3,000-3,500 kWh/tonne. Mercury cells: 3,200-3,800 kWh/tonne. **AC to DC conversion:** Rectifiers (silicon-controlled rectifiers SCR or thyristors) convert grid AC power to DC, efficiency 96-98% (losses as heat, 2-4% of power). Total AC consumption: 2,050-2,550 kWh/tonne NaOH including rectification. **Power supply:** 50-200 cells × 3V = 150-600V DC, 100-400 kA current. Substation transformers (50-150 MVA) step down grid voltage (110-220 kV AC) to 400-1000V AC, rectifiers convert to DC. Power factor correction (capacitor banks) maintain PF >0.95 (utilities penalize low PF). **Auxiliary power:** Pumps (brine, caustic recirculation) 50-150 kWh/tonne, compressors (chlorine, hydrogen) 100-300 kWh/tonne, cooling water 30-80 kWh/tonne, controls/instruments 10-30 kWh/tonne. Total plant consumption: 2,200-2,900 kWh/tonne NaOH (DC cells + auxiliaries). Electricity: largest operating cost, 40-60% of production cost (at $40-80/MWh electricity price, energy cost $88-232 per tonne NaOH).

**Step 143-165: Chlorine Gas Processing - Cooling, Drying, Compression**
Raw chlorine from anode: 85-95°C, saturated with water vapor (45-55 kPa H₂O, corresponds to 3-5 kg H₂O per kg Cl₂ in gas phase). **Cooling (primary desiccation):** Cool gas to 10-20°C in shell-and-tube heat exchangers (titanium tubes, chlorine inside, cooling water shell, titanium resists Cl₂ corrosion - steel rapidly fails). Condensed water separates as brine droplets (equilibrium shifts, water vapor capacity drops from 45 kPa at 90°C to 1.2 kPa at 10°C, ~96% of moisture condenses). Knockout drums (titanium or PVC-lined steel, vertical cylindrical, 1-3m diameter, 3-8m tall) separate liquid (dilute brine + chlorine solution, pH 2-4) from gas. Gravity settling 0.5-2 min residence. Mist eliminators (chevron-type vanes, wire mesh pads) remove entrained droplets <10 µm. Cooled chlorine: 10-15°C, 5-10 g H₂O/kg Cl₂ (still too wet, must dry to <10 ppm H₂O for most applications, <1 ppm for liquefaction). **Drying (acid desiccation):** Pass through packed towers filled with concentrated sulfuric acid (98% H₂SO₄, strong hygroscopic desiccant). Tower: 0.5-2m diameter, 5-15m tall, ceramic Raschig rings or structured packing (PTFE or ceramic, resist Cl₂ + H₂SO₄). Chlorine gas flows up, sulfuric acid trickles down (countercurrent contact, acid absorbs water, dilutes to 85-92% H₂SO₄). Dried chlorine: <10 ppm H₂O. Acid regeneration: continuously circulate diluted acid to reconcentrator (electric heater or steam-heated evaporator, boil water off, restore 98%). Alternative: concentrated calcium chloride (CaCl₂) beds (older technology, batch operation, hygroscopic CaCl₂ + water → CaCl₂·6H₂O deliquescent brine). Alternative: refrigerated dryers (cool to -40°C, freeze moisture, but risks Cl₂ hydrate formation Cl₂·8H₂O ice-like solid, plugs equipment).

**Step 166-180: Chlorine Compression and Liquefaction**
Dried chlorine gas: 10-20°C, atmospheric pressure (slight positive 0.05-0.2 bar to prevent air ingress), ready for compression or direct use. **Compression:** Multi-stage centrifugal or reciprocating compressors (carbon steel or titanium, dry Cl₂ non-corrosive to steel if <0.1% H₂O, wet Cl₂ + steel → FeCl₃ corrosion). Typically 2-4 stages, compress to 8-15 bar. Intercooling: 10-25°C between stages (condenses further moisture if any, cool to maintain gas phase, efficiency). First stage: 1 bar → 3-4 bar, second stage: 3-4 bar → 8-10 bar, optional third: 8-10 bar → 12-15 bar. Power: 100-200 kWh per tonne Cl₂ (compressed to 10 bar). **Liquefaction:** Cool compressed chlorine to below boiling point (-34.0°C at 1 atm, or 10-25°C at 8-10 bar, phase diagram). Refrigeration: ammonia or Freon chillers cool brine (CaCl₂ brine -30 to -40°C) or direct refrigerant evaporators. Condenser: shell-and-tube, chlorine gas enters 10 bar/25°C, exits as liquid -15 to 5°C/8-10 bar (subcooled to prevent vaporization). Liquid chlorine: 1.40-1.47 g/mL density (at 10°C/8 bar), amber-yellow liquid, stored in pressure vessels. **Storage:** Liquid Cl₂ at 8-12 bar, 0-25°C in carbon steel tanks (horizontal or vertical cylindrical, 20-200 tonne capacity), rubber-lined or titanium for high-spec. Pressure relief valves (PRV) prevent overpressure if warming (thermal expansion, vapor pressure rises). Tanker trucks: 15-20 tonne capacity, DOT/ISO specification pressure vessels. Railcars: 50-90 tonne capacity, chlorine-specific design. ISO containers: 20-25 tonne, intermodal shipping. Cylinders: 50-900 kg, industrial supply. **Gaseous chlorine (alternative):** Many applications use gaseous Cl₂ directly from cells (no compression/liquefaction), pipe to adjacent plants (integrated complexes, PVC plants co-located with chlor-alkali). Pressure: 0.05-0.5 bar positive, temperature: 15-40°C. Piping: titanium, PTFE-lined steel, PVC/CPVC (for dry Cl₂), Hastelloy C-276 (nickel alloy, wet Cl₂). Flow measurement: mass flow meters (Coriolis or thermal), avoid orifice plates (corrosion, plugging).

**Step 181-195: Chlorine Applications and Market**
**PVC (polyvinyl chloride) production:** Largest use, 35% of chlorine demand (25 Mt/year Cl₂ for PVC). Process: ethylene + chlorine → ethylene dichloride (EDC, 1,2-dichloroethane, C₂H₄Cl₂) via direct chlorination or oxychlorination. EDC → vinyl chloride monomer (VCM, C₂H₃Cl) by thermal cracking. VCM → PVC polymer (suspension or emulsion polymerization). Stoichiometry: 0.57 kg Cl₂ per kg PVC (plus recycled chlorine from VCM cracking). PVC uses: pipes (40%, construction water/sewer), profiles (window frames, 20%), films/sheets (packaging, 15%), cables (insulation, 10%), other 15%. **Organic chemicals:** 25% of Cl₂ (18 Mt/year). EDC/VCM (mentioned above). Chloromethanes: methyl chloride CH₃Cl (silicones precursor), methylene chloride CH₂Cl₂ (solvents, paint strippers, pharma), chloroform CHCl₃ (refrigerants, Teflon precursor), carbon tetrachloride CCl₄ (CFCs, now banned, legacy). Phosgene COCl₂: Cl₂ + CO → COCl₂ (produces polycarbonates, isocyanates for polyurethanes, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals). Epichlorohydrin: allyl chloride + Cl₂/HOCl → epichlorohydrin (epoxy resins precursor). Perchloroethylene C₂Cl₄ (dry cleaning solvent, declining). Chlorobenzene C₆H₅Cl (pesticides, dyes). Propylene oxide via chlorohydrin process (declining, replaced by direct oxidation). **Pulp/paper bleaching:** 10% of Cl₂ (7 Mt/year). Elemental chlorine bleaching (ECF elemental chlorine-free largely replaced this, but Cl₂ still used for chlorine dioxide ClO₂ generation: Cl₂ + NaClO₂ → 2ClO₂ + NaCl, safer/more selective bleaching). Water treatment: direct Cl₂ gas or hypochlorite (Cl₂ + water → HOCl hypochlorous acid, disinfectant). **Titanium dioxide (TiO₂) production:** 4% of Cl₂ (3 Mt/year). Chloride process: TiO₂ ore (rutile, ilmenite) + Cl₂ + carbon → TiCl₄ (titanium tetrachloride) at 900-1,000°C. TiCl₄ + O₂ → TiO₂ + 2Cl₂ (chlorine recovered, recycled, net loss 5-10%). TiO₂: white pigment, paints, plastics, paper. **Aluminum chloride AlCl₃:** Dry Cl₂ + Al metal → AlCl₃ (Lewis acid catalyst, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, polyaluminum chloride for water treatment). **Water treatment and disinfection:** 10% of Cl₂ (7 Mt/year). Municipal water: Cl₂ gas dissolved in water (0.5-2 ppm free chlorine, kills bacteria, viruses, protozoa). Swimming pools: Cl₂ or hypochlorite (1-3 ppm). Wastewater: disinfection, odor control. Industrial: cooling towers (biocide), food processing (sanitization), breweries, beverage. Alternative: sodium hypochlorite NaOCl (bleach), calcium hypochlorite Ca(OCl)₂ (solid bleach), chlorine dioxide ClO₂ (no chlorinated byproducts THMs). **Other uses:** Bromine production (seawater bromide oxidation, Cl₂ + 2Br⁻ → Br₂ + 2Cl⁻). Ferric chloride FeCl₃ (water treatment coagulant, PCB etching). Hydrogen chloride HCl (Cl₂ + H₂ → 2HCl, used in PVC, pickling steel, synthesis). Hydrochloric acid (HCl dissolved in water, 30-37%, industrial acid). Chlorinated paraffins (lubricant additives, flame retardants, PVC plasticizers). Pesticides, pharmaceuticals (many contain chlorine - chlorinated compounds 25% of pharmaceuticals).

Price: $0.25/kg ($250/tonne) represents liquid chlorine bulk price. Actual market prices $200-600/tonne (volatile, 2010-2024 range, low $180 in oversupply 2015-2016, high $700 in tight markets 2021-2022). Chlorine economics tied to caustic soda (co-product, "electrochemical unit" ECU pricing balances both). Regions with strong PVC demand → tight chlorine supply → high prices. Regions with alumina/chemicals demand (caustic-driven) → excess chlorine → low prices, sometimes vented or destroyed (burning: Cl₂ + H₂ → 2HCl, safer disposal). Chlorine-caustic ratio imbalance: major industry issue, plants optimize production based on higher-value co-product. Per kg NaOH: 0.886 kg Cl₂ co-produced. If NaOH sells $0.35/kg, Cl₂ $0.25/kg → total revenue $0.35 + (0.886 × 0.25) = $0.57/kg NaOH basis, minus $0.25 input costs = $0.32/kg margin (before capex/labor).
