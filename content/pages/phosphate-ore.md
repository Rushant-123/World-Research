**Top Market Leaders:**

Sedimentary rock containing phosphorus - essential nutrient for agriculture. Phosphorite (phosphate rock): 10-40% P₂O₅ (phosphorus pentoxide equivalent). Mineral: fluorapatite Ca₅(PO₄)₃F (42% P₂O₅). Uses: 90% fertilizer production (phosphoric acid → MAP, DAP, triple superphosphate), 5% animal feed supplements, 5% industrial phosphates (detergents, food additives, flame retardants). Global production: 240 million tonnes/year.

**Step 1-15: Geological Formation and Reserves**
Phosphate deposits form in marine environments. Ancient oceans: upwelling zones (deep water rich in phosphorus rises to photic zone) → algae bloom → die, settle to seabed → bones, fecal pellets, organic matter accumulate → burial, diagenesis (chemical transformation) → phosphorite beds. Time: Cretaceous to Miocene (140-5 million years ago). Thickness: 1-30 meters. Grades: 15-35% P₂O₅ typical. Ore bodies: sedimentary (flat-lying beds, large areal extent 10-1,000+ km²), igneous (carbonatite complexes - rare, high-grade 5-15% P₂O₅ in rock, associated with rare earths). Global reserves: 71 billion tonnes phosphate rock (USGS 2024). Morocco + Western Sahara: 50 billion tonnes (70% of world reserves, strategic dominance). China: 3.2 billion tonnes. Egypt: 2.8 billion. Algeria, Syria, Russia: 1-2 billion each. USA: 1 billion (Florida, North Carolina, Idaho). R/P ratio: 300+ years (but high-quality reserves limited, grades declining).

**Step 16-32: [Open Pit Mining](dragline-excavation)**
Most phosphate: open pit (shallow depth 10-50m, large tonnage). Overburden (waste rock/sand/clay above ore): 1-15 meters. Strip overburden with dragline (bucket 20-80 m³, boom 100m reach) or excavators. Dragline: swing bucket over spoil pile, cast overburden. Advance in parallel strips. Selective mining: GPS-guided (grade control model from drilling, direct equipment to high-grade zones). Ore: excavate with draglines, front-end loaders (bucket 10-20 m³), or hydraulic excavators. Load haul trucks: 100-200 tonne capacity. Haul to beneficiation plant or wash plant (2-10 km distance). Production rate: 5-50 million tonnes/year depending on operation. Largest mines: Khouribga, Morocco (OCP, 40+ Mt/year), Florida phosphate district (Mosaic, 10-15 Mt/year).

**Step 33-50: [Beneficiation](ore-processing) - Washing and Flotation**
Mined ore: 10-20% P₂O₅ (contaminated with clay, sand, organics). Upgrade by beneficiation. **Washing:** phosphate matrix (clay-sand-phosphate mixture) → hydroseparator or log washer. Tumble in water, clay disperses (forms slurry), phosphate pebbles sink (density 3.0-3.2 g/cm³), sand intermediate (2.65 g/cm³). Screen: +1mm pebble phosphate (25-30% P₂O₅), -1mm +150 µm sand, -150 µm clay slimes. Clay slimes: pump to settling ponds (waste, environmental concern - phosphogypsum stacks leach to groundwater). **Flotation (for fine phosphate):** grind -1mm fraction to -150 µm (liberate phosphate from quartz). Flotation: fatty acid collectors (tall oil, 0.5-1.5 kg/tonne) make phosphate hydrophobic at pH 8-9 (soda ash). Frothers: pine oil, MIBC. Phosphate floats, silica and clays sink (reverse flotation also used - float silica with cationic collectors, depress phosphate). Concentrate: 28-32% P₂O₅ (typical), 65-75% recovery.

**Step 51-68: [Drying](rotary-dryer) and Product Preparation**
Flotation concentrate: 20-30% moisture. Thicken in settling tanks to 60-70% solids. Filter: vacuum disc filters or filter presses. Filter cake: 8-12% moisture. Dry in [rotary dryer](rotary-dryer): inclined rotating drum 3-5m diameter, 15-30m long, hot air (600-800°C from natural gas or coal burner) flows countercurrent. Product moisture: <1% (prevents caking during storage, ship transport). Capacity: 50-300 tonnes/hour. Cool in rotary cooler to <80°C. Screen to size: -6mm or -12mm (removes oversize). Pebble phosphate (coarse, +6mm, 28-32% P₂O₅): direct to market (used in wet-process phosphoric acid plants, preferred feedstock - less fines). Concentrate (fines, -1mm, 30-35% P₂O₅): bag or bulk ship. Specifications: P₂O₅ content (%), CaO (calcium oxide), Fe₂O₃ (iron), Al₂O₃ (aluminum), MgO (magnesium), SO₃ (sulfate), F (fluorine), organic matter (%), moisture (%).

**Step 69-85: Product Grades and Applications**
**Fertilizer grade:** 28-32% P₂O₅, 40-52% CaO, <4% Fe₂O₃+Al₂O₃ (aluminum and iron consume acid in phosphoric acid production, penalty elements). Ratios important: CaO/P₂O₅ = 1.4-1.6 (ideal for wet-process acid, stoichiometry of Ca₅(PO₄)₃F). Mg, F, organics: form impurities in acid, acceptable at low levels. Uses: phosphoric acid plants (wet process), ground rock phosphate (direct application to soil - low solubility, only effective in acidic soils). **Feed grade:** 18-20% P (≈41-46% P₂O₅), <0.1% F (fluorine toxic to animals), low heavy metals (Cd <50 ppm, Pb <10 ppm, As <10 ppm). Defluorinated: treat with steam + silica at 1,000-1,500°C, volatilize fluorine (SiF₄), reduce to <0.1% F. Animal feed supplement (monocalcium phosphate MCP, dicalcium phosphate DCP). **Industrial grade:** high purity, low impurities. Food-grade phosphoric acid → sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP, detergent builder), trisodium phosphate (TSP, cleaner), phosphate food additives (sodium phosphates, calcium phosphates - leavening agents, emulsifiers, pH buffers).

**Step 86-102: Wet-Process Phosphoric Acid Production**
90% of phosphate rock → phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) via wet process. React phosphate rock with sulfuric acid: Ca₅(PO₄)₃F + 5H₂SO₄ + 10H₂O → 3H₃PO₄ + 5(CaSO₄·2H₂O) + HF. Reactor: agitated tank, add ground phosphate rock + 93% sulfuric acid + recycle acid. Temperature: 70-80°C (dihydrate process, CaSO₄·2H₂O gypsum crystals form). Exothermic (releases heat). Residence time: 4-6 hours. Slurry: phosphoric acid (28-32% P₂O₅) + gypsum crystals. Filter: rotary vacuum filter, separate acid from gypsum. Gypsum cake (phosphogypsum): 5 tonnes per tonne P₂O₅ produced (massive waste stream, 280 Mt/year globally). Disposal: stack in piles 50-100m tall (gypstack), or sea dumping (banned in most countries), or attempt utilization (wallboard, cement - limited uptake due to impurities, radioactivity). Filtrate: crude phosphoric acid (28-32% P₂O₅, green-brown color, impurities Fe, Al, Mg, F, organic matter, suspended solids). Concentrate by evaporation to 40-54% P₂O₅ (merchant grade). Purify for food/industrial grade: solvent extraction (tributyl phosphate extracts H₃PO₄, leaves impurities), recrystallization, carbon treatment.

**Step 103-118: Fertilizer Production from Phosphoric Acid**
**Monoammonium phosphate (MAP):** NH₃ + H₃PO₄ → NH₄H₂PO₄ (11-52-0 NPK grade, 11% N, 52% P₂O₅, 0% K₂O). React ammonia gas with phosphoric acid in granulator. Granulate by agglomeration (1-4mm granules), dry, cool, screen. Production: 30-40 Mt/year globally. **Diammonium phosphate (DAP):** 2NH₃ + H₃PO₄ → (NH₄)₂HPO₄ (18-46-0 grade, 18% N, 46% P₂O₅). Higher nitrogen than MAP. Production: 50-60 Mt/year. Most widely used phosphate fertilizer. **Triple superphosphate (TSP):** Ca₅(PO₄)₃F + 7H₃PO₄ → 5Ca(H₂PO₄)₂ + HF (0-46-0 grade, no nitrogen). React phosphate rock with phosphoric acid. Granulate, dry. Production: 5-10 Mt/year (declining, DAP/MAP preferred). Total fertilizer P₂O₅ consumption: 45-50 Mt/year (2023).

**Step 119-133: Environmental and Health Issues**
**Fluorine emissions:** Phosphate rock contains 3-4% fluorine (as fluorapatite). Phosphoric acid plants release HF and SiF₄ (silicon tetrafluoride). Scrub with water → H₂SiF₆ (fluorosilicic acid, used in water fluoridation or sold to aluminum smelters). Incomplete capture → fluorine emissions (damage vegetation, cattle fluorosis). Regulated: emission limits <50 mg/m³ exhaust. **Phosphogypsum stacks:** 5 tonnes waste per tonne P₂O₅. Contains: residual phosphoric acid (pH 2-4), fluorides (0.5-1.5%), heavy metals (Cd 5-50 ppm, U+Th radionuclides). Radioactivity: uranium and thorium naturally present in phosphate rock (5-300 ppm U, concentrate in gypsum during processing). Gypstacks: TENORM (technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material). Radon emissions: Rn-222 (decay product of U-238, radioactive gas, alpha emitter). EPA regulations: liner requirements, monitoring, closure plans. Seepage: acidic, high-phosphate water contaminates aquifers (nitrate, fluoride exceed drinking water standards). Mitigation: liner systems, seepage collection, water treatment (neutralize with lime, precipitate phosphates). **Cadmium in fertilizers:** Phosphate rock contains 5-50 ppm Cd (varies by deposit, Moroccan rock ~30 ppm, USA Florida ~10 ppm). Cadmium transfers to fertilizer (MAP, DAP contain 5-30 ppm Cd). Application to soil → Cd accumulates (soil levels rise 0.01-0.1 ppm Cd per year, decades of application). Crop uptake (lettuce, rice, wheat accumulate Cd, human dietary exposure). Regulations: EU limits fertilizer Cd (<60 ppm, phasing to <40 ppm by 2034).

**Step 134-145: Peak Phosphorus and Resource Depletion**
Unlike nitrogen (atmospheric source, Haber-Bosch synthesis), phosphorus: geological resource, finite, non-substitutable, essential for all life. Peak phosphorus concept: production reaches maximum, declines as high-grade reserves deplete (analogous to peak oil). Debate: optimists (300+ years reserves, technology improves extraction/efficiency, demand saturates). Pessimists (high-quality reserves peak 2030-2050, increasing mining costs, geopolitical concentration Morocco 70% reserves). Hubbard curve modeling: global peak 2030-2070 depending on assumptions. Challenges: declining ore grades (30-35% P₂O₅ historical, new mines 15-25% P₂O₅, require more energy/water to beneficiate). Increasing impurities (Cd, U, organics - higher processing costs). Geopolitical risk: Morocco controls reserves, export restrictions possible. Mitigation strategies: (1) Efficiency: precision agriculture (variable rate application, reduce over-fertilization, typical 40% of applied P lost to runoff/erosion). (2) Recycling: recover P from wastewater (struvite precipitation MgNH₄PO₄, used as slow-release fertilizer), manure (close nutrient loop, animal wastes 20-30% of agricultural P). (3) Substitutes: none for phosphorus nutrient function, but microbial inoculants (mycorrhizae enhance root P uptake, reduce fertilizer need 20-40%).

**Step 146-155: Market, Trade, and Economics**
Phosphate rock production (2023): 240 million tonnes. Top producers: China 95 Mt (40%, mostly domestic consumption), Morocco+Western Sahara 40 Mt (17%), USA 22 Mt (9%), Russia 14 Mt, Jordan 10 Mt, Saudi Arabia 7 Mt, Egypt 6 Mt, Peru 5 Mt, Tunisia 5 Mt. Exports: Morocco 32 Mt (global leader, 40% of traded rock), Jordan 8 Mt, Egypt 5 Mt. Importers: India 15 Mt (limited domestic resources, imports for fertilizer industry), China 5-10 Mt (supplements domestic), Europe 10 Mt. Phosphate rock price: $80-200/tonne FOB (2010-2024 range, volatile). Spike to $430/tonne in 2008 (commodity supercycle), crash to $80 in 2016 (oversupply). 2022-2024: $150-200/tonne (Russian sanctions disrupted potash/fertilizer trade, prices rose). Fertilizer price link: DAP $300-800/tonne farm-gate (follows phosphate rock + ammonia + sulfuric acid input costs). Phosphate rock cost structure: mining 40-60% (labor, fuel, equipment), beneficiation 20-30%, drying 10-15%, transport 10-20%. Economies of scale: large integrated operations (OCP Morocco, Mosaic USA) produce rock + acid + fertilizer, $30-60/tonne cash cost. Small miners: $60-100/tonne.

Price: $0.40/kg ($400/tonne) represents beneficiated phosphate rock ready for chemical processing. Used primarily for phosphoric acid (→ fertilizers 90%, or for semiconductor-grade electronic-grade phosphoric acid after thermal process purification). Per chip allocation: negligible (micrograms of phosphate-derived phosphoric acid used in aluminum etch or as trace additive, amortized cost <$0.001 per chip). The $0.4 represents commodity phosphate rock price, not per-chip cost allocation.
