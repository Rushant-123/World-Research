1. Lithium-rich brine in salt flats (salars)
2. Brine grade: 500-2,000 ppm lithium
3. Exploration drilling identifies brine zones
4. Production wells drilled to aquifer
5. Well depth: 20-100 meters
6. Submersible pumps installed
7. Pumping rate: 10-50 liters per second per well
8. Brine pumped to evaporation ponds
9. Pond system: series of large shallow ponds
10. Total area: several square kilometers
11. Lined with clay or geomembrane
12. Solar evaporation concentrates lithium
13. Initial concentration: 0.15% lithium
14. Evaporation stages over 12-18 months
15. Magnesium and sulfate precipitate first
16. Sequential ponds increase concentration
17. Final brine: 3-6% lithium
18. Lithium chloride solution to plant
19. Precipitation with sodium carbonate
20. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) precipitates
21. Filtration and washing
22. Drying at 200-250°C
23. Product purity: 99.5% Li2CO3
24. Packaging in bulk bags or containers
25. Alternative: lithium hydroxide production
26. Conversion with lime (calcium hydroxide)
27. Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) for batteries
28. Potassium often byproduct (KCl)
29. Boron may be recovered
30. Water consumption minimized (mostly evaporation)
31. Fresh water for washing and processing
32. Solar energy primary input
33. Environmental: brine aquifer management
34. Monitoring prevents over-extraction
35. Baseline hydrology studies
36. Wildlife (flamingos) protected
37. Production: 10,000-40,000 tons Li2CO3 per year
38. Operating cost: $3,000-4,000 per ton Li2CO3
39. Mine life: 20-50 years
