# How to Make Electricity

Electricity is the flow of electric charge, typically generated at power plants and delivered through an extensive grid system to homes and businesses. It's measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

## What is it?

Energy in the form of moving electrons through conductive materials. In the US, electricity is generated at centralized power plants, stepped up to high voltage for transmission, then stepped down for safe use in buildings. The grid operates at 60 Hz alternating current (AC).

## Steps to Make:

**Generation at Power Plant:**
1. At a [Power Plant](power-plant), burn [Fuel Source](fuel-source) (coal, natural gas, or oil) in a [Boiler](industrial-boiler)
2. For coal plant: pulverize coal into fine powder, blow into boiler, ignite
3. Combustion releases heat - flames reach 1,400-1,700°C
4. Heat boils water in boiler tubes into high-pressure steam (540°C, 2,400 psi)
5. Direct pressurized steam at blades of [Turbine Generator](turbine-generator)
6. Steam pushes turbine blades, spinning the rotor at 3,600 RPM (60 Hz) or 3,000 RPM (50 Hz in some countries)
7. Turbine shaft connects to generator rotor - large electromagnet spinning inside copper coils (stator)
8. Rotating magnetic field induces alternating current (AC) in stator windings
9. Generator produces 3-phase AC electricity at 11,000-25,000 volts
10. Typical large generator: 500-1,500 megawatts output
11. Exhaust steam exits turbine at low pressure
12. Condense exhaust steam back to water using [Cooling Water](cooling-water-system) from river/lake/cooling towers
13. Pump condensed water back to boiler (closed loop)
14. [Utility Workers](utility-workers) monitor plant operation 24/7 from control room

**Voltage Step-Up:**
15. Generator output connects to [Step-Up Transformer](power-transformer) located at power plant
16. Transformer increases voltage to 115,000-765,000 volts for transmission
17. High voltage = lower current for same power (P = V × I)
18. Lower current means less resistive heating loss in wires (P_loss = I² × R)
19. Typical transmission voltages: 115kV, 230kV, 345kV, 500kV, or 765kV
20. Transformer is oil-cooled, weighs 100-400 tons

**Long-Distance Transmission:**
21. Electricity flows into [Transmission Lines](transmission-lines) - three thick aluminum cables
22. Cables suspended from [Transmission Towers](steel-towers) (lattice steel structures 30-60 meters tall)
23. [Ceramic Insulators](insulators) prevent electricity from flowing to ground through towers
24. Insulators must withstand 500,000+ volts
25. Transmission lines run for 50-500 kilometers from plant to cities
26. Lines follow rights-of-way cleared through forests or across open land
27. Typical line can carry 500-2,000 megawatts
28. Power loss during transmission: 2-4% (resistive heating)
29. Lines sag in summer (aluminum expands with heat), tighten in winter
30. Utility workers inspect lines regularly using helicopters and drones

**Substations (Voltage Reduction):**
31. Near cities, lines enter [Substation](electrical-substation) - large fenced facility with transformers and switchgear
32. [Step-Down Transformers](distribution-transformer) reduce voltage to 12,000-35,000 volts (subtransmission)
33. Circuit breakers and switches allow utility to reroute power or isolate faults
34. Substation may serve 50,000-500,000 people
35. Electricity exits substation on multiple [Distribution Lines](power-lines)

**Local Distribution:**
36. Distribution lines run on [Utility Poles](wooden-poles) along streets (10-15 meters tall)
37. Lines carry 3-phase AC at 12kV or 25kV
38. Span between poles: 40-60 meters
39. Utility workers install and maintain lines using bucket trucks

**Neighborhood Transformer:**
40. Every few houses/buildings, a [Step-Down Transformer](distribution-transformer) (pole-mounted or pad-mounted) reduces voltage
41. Transformer steps 12kV down to 120/240 volts (split-phase in US) or 230V (single-phase in Europe)
42. One transformer serves 5-20 houses typically
43. Transformer is oil-filled, rated 25-50 kVA for residential
44. Secondary winding has center tap (neutral) creating two 120V phases 180° apart

**Service to Building:**
45. [Service Drop](service-wire) connects from transformer to your building
46. Three wires: two hot (120V each) and one neutral
47. Wires attach to weather head on roof or exterior wall
48. Service entrance cable runs down to [Electric Meter](kwh-meter)
49. Meter measures energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
50. Meter has spinning disc (old style) or digital display (smart meter)
51. Smart meters transmit usage data to utility wirelessly

**Building Electrical Panel:**
52. From meter, wires enter main electrical panel (breaker box)
53. Main breaker disconnects entire building (typically 100-200 amp rating)
54. Panel divides electricity into circuits using [Circuit Breakers](circuit-breaker)
55. Each circuit breaker protects one circuit (15-20 amps for outlets, 30-50 amps for appliances)
56. Breaker trips (opens circuit) if current exceeds rating - prevents fire from overheating wires
57. [Copper Wiring](electrical-wire) runs from panel through walls to outlets and fixtures
58. Typical house has 10-30 circuits

**In-Wall Wiring:**
59. Electricians install copper wires in conduit or Romex cable during construction
60. Each circuit has hot wire (black or red, 120V), neutral wire (white, 0V), and ground wire (bare or green, safety)
61. Wire gauge determines current capacity: 14 AWG (15A), 12 AWG (20A), 10 AWG (30A)
62. Thicker wire has less resistance, can carry more current safely

**At the Outlet:**
63. Hot and neutral wires connect to outlet terminals
64. Ground wire connects to ground screw (connected to metal box and earth ground rod)
65. When you plug in a device, it completes circuit between hot and neutral
66. Electrons flow from hot wire, through device, back through neutral wire
67. Device converts electrical energy to other forms (light, heat, motion, computation)
68. Current in AC system alternates direction 60 times per second (60 Hz)

**Grid Balancing:**
69. Grid operators continuously monitor supply and demand
70. When demand increases (hot afternoon, everyone turns on AC), operators dispatch more generators
71. When demand drops (night), take generators offline or reduce output
72. Frequency must stay exactly 60.00 Hz (or 50.00 Hz) - varies ±0.05 Hz
73. If supply < demand, frequency drops - risk of blackout
74. If supply > demand, frequency rises - damages equipment
75. Grid operates as synchronized network - all generators spin in phase
76. Modern grids use automated control systems to balance in milliseconds

**Safety and Grounding:**
77. Ground wire provides path for fault current if hot wire touches metal chassis
78. This trips breaker immediately, preventing electrocution
79. GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlets detect current imbalance, trip in 0.03 seconds
80. Required in bathrooms, kitchens, and outdoor outlets
81. Lightning strikes dissipate to ground through grounding system

**Energy Loss in System:**
- Generation efficiency: 33-60% (thermal power plants waste heat)
- Transmission losses: 2-4%
- Distribution losses: 4-6%
- Overall grid efficiency: 30-55% from fuel to end use

**Power Delivery Speed:**
- Electromagnetic wave propagates at ~70% speed of light (210,000 km/s)
- Electricity arrives at your outlet within milliseconds of generation
- But electrons themselves drift slowly (millimeters per second)
- It's the electromagnetic field that delivers energy, not individual electron movement

The electric grid is one of humanity's largest machines, operating 24/7 with 99.9%+ reliability in developed countries. It requires constant real-time coordination between thousands of generators, millions of miles of wires, and billions of end-use devices.
