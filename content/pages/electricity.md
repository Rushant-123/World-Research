# How to Make Electricity

Electricity is the flow of electric charge, typically generated at power plants and delivered through an extensive grid system to homes and businesses. It's measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

## What is it?

Energy in the form of moving electrons through conductive materials. In the US, electricity is generated at centralized power plants, stepped up to high voltage for transmission, then stepped down for safe use in buildings. The grid operates at 60 Hz alternating current (AC).

## Steps to Make:

1. Generate electricity at a [Power Plant](power-plant) by converting energy from fuel into electrical energy
2. The power plant burns [Fuel Source](fuel-source) (coal, natural gas) or uses other energy sources (nuclear, hydro, solar, wind)
3. The energy spins a turbine connected to a generator
4. The generator converts mechanical rotation into electrical current
5. The electricity comes out at medium voltage (around 25,000 volts)
6. Feed the electricity into [Transformers](electrical-transformers) that step up the voltage to 345,000-765,000 volts
7. High voltage reduces energy loss during long-distance transmission
8. Send the electricity through [Transmission Lines](transmission-lines) - large metal towers carrying thick cables across long distances
9. [Utility Workers](utility-workers) maintain the transmission infrastructure
10. At substations near cities and towns, step down the voltage using more transformers
11. The electricity enters the [Distribution Infrastructure](distribution-infrastructure) - local power lines on wooden poles
12. More transformers step down voltage again to 120/240 volts for household use
13. The electricity flows through the distribution lines to your neighborhood
14. A service line connects from the pole to your building
15. The electricity passes through your meter which measures consumption
16. It enters your building's electrical panel
17. Circuit breakers protect each circuit from overload
18. Electricity flows through wires in the walls to outlets and devices
19. Your device (computer, light, etc.) uses the electricity to operate
20. The circuit is completed as electrons flow back through the neutral wire

This entire process happens nearly instantaneously - electricity travels at close to the speed of light through conductors. The grid must constantly balance supply and demand in real-time.
