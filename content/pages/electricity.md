Fundamental energy carrier - powers modern civilization. Global production: 29,000 TWh/year (2023), 60% fossil fuels, 25% renewables, 10% nuclear, 5% other. Electricity: flow of electrons through conductors, generated by converting mechanical energy (rotating turbines) or solar energy (photovoltaics) into electrical energy. Delivered via transmission/distribution grid at 50 Hz (Europe, Asia) or 60 Hz (Americas). Essential for: industry, transportation, computing, lighting, heating/cooling, communications.

**Step 1-15: Coal-Fired Power Generation - Fuel Preparation**
[Coal](coal-mining): sedimentary rock, 50-90% carbon, formed from ancient plant matter (Carboniferous period 300M years ago), buried, compressed, heated over millions of years (peat → lignite → sub-bituminous → bituminous → anthracite). Power plant coal: bituminous (60-80% C, 25-35 MJ/kg heating value) or sub-bituminous (45-60% C, 20-25 MJ/kg). Delivered by rail (unit trains 100-150 cars, 10,000-15,000 tonnes), barge, or conveyor from adjacent mine. **Coal yard storage:** Open stockpiles 50,000-500,000 tonnes (weeks of inventory), bulldozers move, reclaim. Spontaneous combustion risk (slow oxidation generates heat, >70°C ignites), spray water, compact piles. **Coal handling:** Conveyor belts transport to plant (1-3 km, 1,000-3,000 tonnes/hour capacity). Crush in jaw/hammer mills (300mm → 50mm). **Pulverizers:** Ball mills or bowl mills (vertical spindle, rotating bowl, spring-loaded rollers grind coal). Output: 70% passing 75 µm (talcum powder fineness, increases surface area, burns rapidly, completely). Air classification: light fine particles entrained in hot air (300-350°C primary air from forced-draft fans), heavy particles return to mill. Coal-air mixture (0.3-0.5 kg coal/kg air) pneumatically conveyed to burners. Large plant: 4-8 pulverizers, 50-80 tonnes/hour each, 500 MW consumes 200 tonnes/hour coal (16 GJ/MWh thermal input, 38% efficiency = 6 GJ/MWh electrical output).

**Step 16-35: Coal Combustion in Boiler**
**[Power plant](power-plant) boiler:** Massive steel furnace 30-50m tall, 10-20m wide/deep, walls lined with water-tube membrane panels (tubes 50-75mm diameter, spaced 5-10mm, fin-welded, water circulates, absorbs radiant heat). **Burners:** 16-48 burners arranged in layers on front/rear walls or in corners (tangential firing). Pulverized coal-air mixture injected at 30-50 m/s, ignites immediately (autoignition temperature 300-400°C, furnace already >1,000°C from prior combustion). **Combustion process:** Coal particles (50 µm) heat rapidly, volatile matter (hydrocarbons, tar) vaporizes, burns as flame (yellow-orange, 1,200-1,400°C). Char (carbon residue) oxidizes: C + O₂ → CO₂ (exothermic, releases 394 kJ/mol, main heat source). Flame fills furnace volume (10,000-50,000 m³), radiant heat transfer to water walls (80% of total heat transfer, remainder in convection sections). Secondary air injected above burners (overfire air, reduces NOx formation, ensures complete burnout). **Residence time:** 2-4 seconds in furnace (sufficient for 95-99% carbon burnout). Unburned carbon in fly ash: 1-5% (measure of combustion efficiency, <3% target). **Flue gas composition:** N₂ 70-75%, CO₂ 12-15%, H₂O 6-10%, O₂ 3-5% (excess air ensures complete combustion), SOx 500-2,000 ppm (from sulfur in coal 0.5-3%), NOx 200-500 ppm (thermal NOx from high-temperature N₂ + O₂, fuel NOx from nitrogen in coal 1-2%). Particulates: 10-50 g/Nm³ (fly ash, unburned carbon).

**Step 36-55: Steam Generation and Superheat**
**Water circulation:** Boiler feedwater (purified, <50 ppb dissolved solids, demineralized, deaerated) pumped to drum (steam drum, 2-3m diameter, 10-20m long, top of boiler, 10-20 MPa pressure). Downcomers (large pipes) feed water to lower headers, distribute to furnace wall tubes. Water rises through tubes (natural circulation from density difference, or forced circulation with pumps in supercritical boilers). Absorbs heat: H₂O (liquid, 300-350°C) → H₂O + steam bubbles (nucleate boiling) → steam-water mixture rises to drum. **Steam drum:** Separates steam from water (cyclone separators, baffles remove water droplets, steam exits 99.5+% dry). Saturated steam: 18 MPa, 357°C (saturation temperature at 180 bar), or 25 MPa, 371°C (supercritical, no phase change, water transitions smoothly to steam). Typical subcritical: 16-18 MPa, 540-565°C (after superheat). **Superheater:** Steam passes through tube bundles in hot flue gas path (800-1,100°C gas, convection + radiation heat transfer). Primary superheater → attemperator (spray water to control temperature) → secondary superheater → final superheat 540-565°C (subcritical) or 580-620°C (supercritical/ultra-supercritical USC plants). Steam superheat prevents condensation in turbine (wet steam erodes blades, reduces efficiency). **Reheater:** After steam expands partially in high-pressure turbine (540°C → 300-350°C), return to boiler reheater section, reheat to 540-565°C, send to intermediate-pressure turbine. Reheat cycle improves efficiency 3-5% vs non-reheat. **Steam flow rate:** 500 MW plant: 400-500 kg/s steam (1,400-1,800 tonnes/hour). 1,000 MW: 800-1,000 kg/s.

**Step 56-75: [Steam Turbine](steam-turbine) and Generator**
**Turbine:** Converts thermal/pressure energy to mechanical rotation. High-pressure turbine (HP): steam enters at 16-25 MPa, 540-600°C, expands through 8-15 stages (each stage: fixed nozzle blades accelerate steam, rotating blades extract energy, pressure/temperature drop). Exit: 3-5 MPa, 300-350°C. Intermediate-pressure turbine (IP): reheated steam 3-5 MPa, 540-565°C, expands through 8-12 stages, exit 0.3-0.8 MPa. Low-pressure turbine (LP): 2-3 LP turbines (double-flow, steam enters center, flows outward both directions), expands from 0.5 MPa to condenser vacuum 4-10 kPa (0.04-0.1 bar absolute), exit temperature 30-50°C (near saturation, ~10% moisture content). Last-stage blades: 1-1.5m long (titanium, withstand 3,600 rpm centrifugal stress, 400 MPa, erosion from water droplets). **Turbine speed:** 3,600 rpm (60 Hz, 2-pole generator) or 3,000 rpm (50 Hz), or 1,800/1,500 rpm (4-pole). Synchronized to grid frequency. **Generator:** Turbine shaft directly coupled to generator rotor (no gearbox, 1:1 speed). Rotor: electromagnet (field winding, DC excitation 200-1,000 A at 200-500 V, creates rotating magnetic field). Stator: stationary armature (copper windings, 3-phase, star-connected). Rotor rotation induces AC voltage in stator (Faraday's law, 11-25 kV line-to-line). Generator rating: 500-1,500 MVA (mega-volt-ampere apparent power), 0.85-0.9 power factor (500 MVA × 0.85 = 425 MW real power). Efficiency: 98-99% (losses: resistive heating in windings, eddy currents, windage). Cooling: hydrogen gas (H₂ circulated in sealed casing, lower density than air, reduces windage losses, better heat transfer) or water-cooled (stator windings hollow, deionized water flows through). Generator hydrogen pressure: 3-6 bar, purity >98% (avoid explosion risk with O₂).

**Step 76-90: Condenser and Cooling System**
**Condenser:** LP turbine exhaust steam condenses to water (phase change releases latent heat 2,200 kJ/kg, must reject to environment). Surface condenser: shell-and-tube heat exchanger (steam on shell side, cooling water in tubes, 5,000-15,000 tubes 25mm diameter, 10-20m long, titanium or stainless steel, 5,000-15,000 m² surface area). Vacuum: 4-10 kPa absolute (28-29 inHg vacuum), maintained by condensing steam (vapor condenses, volume reduces 1,600×, creates vacuum). Lower back-pressure = better turbine efficiency (Carnot efficiency η = 1 - T_cold/T_hot, colder condenser improves). **Cooling water:** Once-through cooling (river, lake, ocean water, 20,000-60,000 L/s for 500 MW plant, inlet 10-25°C, outlet 30-40°C, +8-15°C rise) or closed-loop with cooling towers. **Cooling tower:** Evaporative cooling, water sprayed over fill (plastic sheets, increase surface area), air flows upward (natural draft in hyperbolic towers 100-200m tall, or mechanical draft with fans). Evaporation cools water: 1,000 kg/s circulating water, evaporate 15-25 kg/s (1.5-2.5%, latent heat 2,450 kJ/kg removes 37-61 MW thermal). Makeup water replaces evaporation + blowdown (concentrate salts). Water consumption: 1-2 L/kWh (wet cooling tower) vs 0.1 L/kWh (once-through). Dry cooling (air-cooled condensers): zero water use, but 2-5% efficiency penalty (higher back-pressure, used in arid regions, higher capital cost). **Condensate return:** Condensate pumps (10-20 m head) return condensed water to feedwater system, deaerator (removes dissolved O₂, CO₂ to prevent corrosion, <7 ppb O₂ specification), feedwater heaters (preheat with extracted steam from turbine, regenerative cycle improves efficiency 5-8%), boiler feed pumps (high-pressure 18-30 MPa, multistage centrifugal, 5-15 MW power consumption).

**Step 91-105: Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) Generation**
[Natural gas](natural-gas): CH₄ 85-95%, C₂H₆ 3-8%, C₃+ 1-3%, N₂ 1-5%, CO₂ <1% (pipeline quality, 35-40 MJ/Nm³ heating value). Delivered via pipeline (0.5-10 MPa pressure), metered, pressure-regulated. **Gas turbine (combustion turbine, Brayton cycle):** Compressor (15-20 stages axial compressor, compress air from 1 bar to 15-35 bar, temperature rises to 400-600°C, 50-60% of turbine power consumed). Combustion chamber: natural gas mixed with compressed air, burn in 10-20 annular or can combustors (1,300-1,600°C flame, stoichiometric ratio 17:1 air:CH₄ by mass, but run lean 60:1 to limit temperature, excess air). Hot gas expands through turbine (3-5 stages, first-stage blades: single-crystal nickel superalloy MAR-M247, thermal barrier coating yttria-stabilized zirconia YSZ, internal cooling air passages, withstand 1,200-1,400°C gas, 1,000°C metal temperature). Turbine drives compressor + generator (single shaft 3,000/3,600 rpm, or multi-shaft with power turbine 3,000/3,600 rpm, gas generator 5,000-10,000 rpm). Gas turbine efficiency: 35-42% (simple cycle, General Electric 7HA.03 41.6% world record). Exhaust: 500-650°C, 10-12% O₂ (still combustible, use in combined cycle). Gas turbine rating: 100-500 MW (Frame 7/9 industrial, GE HA/Siemens H-class 400-500 MW). Fuel consumption: 7-9 GJ/MWh (38-42% LHV efficiency).

**Step 106-120: Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and Steam Cycle**
**Combined cycle:** Exhaust heat from gas turbine generates steam, drives steam turbine (Rankine cycle), improves overall efficiency to 55-63% (vs 35-42% simple cycle gas turbine, 38-45% coal steam plant). **HRSG (heat recovery steam generator):** Vertical or horizontal boiler, gas turbine exhaust (500-650°C, 300-800 kg/s) passes over tube bundles (no combustion, pure heat transfer). **Triple-pressure HRSG:** Low-pressure (LP) section: generate steam at 0.5-1.5 MPa, 200-250°C (economizer → evaporator → superheater). Intermediate-pressure (IP): 3-5 MPa, 300-350°C. High-pressure (HP): 10-15 MPa, 540-565°C. Feedwater flows countercurrent to gas (cold feedwater enters where gas exits 80-120°C, avoids thermal shock, maximizes heat recovery). Stack temperature: 80-120°C (lower = better efficiency, but risk of acid condensation from SO₂ + H₂O if <120°C, natural gas low sulfur <10 ppm so safe). **Steam turbine:** HP steam → IP steam → LP steam → condenser (similar to coal plant, but smaller, steam flow 100-200 kg/s vs 500-800 kg/s). Steam turbine output: 150-300 MW (for 400 MW gas turbine, ratio ~0.5-0.6). **Total combined cycle output:** 1 × 400 MW gas turbine + 1 × 200 MW steam turbine = 600 MW (2-on-1: 2 gas turbines, 1 steam turbine = 1,000-1,200 MW). Efficiency: 55-63% (GE HA combined cycle 63.08% Bouchain plant France, Siemens H-class 61%). Fuel: 5.7-6.5 GJ/MWh. CO₂ emissions: 320-370 kg/MWh (vs 800-1,000 kg/MWh coal). NGCC dominates new builds (USA 60% of additions 2010-2020, dispatchable, 10-30 minutes start, load-following 10-100% in 10 minutes, complements renewables).

**Step 121-140: Nuclear Power - Reactor Core and Fission**
[Nuclear fuel](enriched-uranium): uranium dioxide UO₂ ceramic pellets (10mm diameter, 15mm long, 95.5% U-238, 3-5% U-235 enriched, natural uranium 0.7% U-235 enriched via gaseous diffusion or centrifuge). Pellets stacked in zirconium alloy tubes (fuel rods, 4m long, 10mm diameter, hermetically sealed). Rods assembled in fuel assemblies (14×14 to 17×17 array, 200-300 rods per assembly, PWR assemblies). Reactor core: 150-250 fuel assemblies (pressurized water reactor PWR, 100-350 tonnes UO₂, 75-150 tonnes U metal, 3-4 tonnes U-235). **Nuclear fission:** Neutron absorbed by U-235: ²³⁵U + n → ²³⁶U* (excited nucleus) → fission fragments (Ba-141 + Kr-92, or Sr-94 + Xe-140, 200+ combinations) + 2-3 neutrons + 200 MeV energy. Fission fragments: highly radioactive (half-lives seconds to years), kinetic energy heats fuel (85% of 200 MeV, 170 MeV = 2.7×10⁻¹¹ J per fission). Chain reaction: 2-3 neutrons released → moderate (slow down) → absorb by other U-235 → fission → exponential growth. **Criticality control:** Neutron population k_eff = 1.000 (exactly critical, steady power). k > 1: supercritical (power increases). k < 1: subcritical (shuts down). Control rods: cadmium or boron carbide B₄C (strong neutron absorbers), inserted into core (decrease reactivity), withdrawn (increase). Fine control: boric acid H₃BO₃ dissolved in coolant (0-2,000 ppm, boron-10 absorbs neutrons). Moderator: light water H₂O (PWR, BWR) or heavy water D₂O (CANDU), or graphite (RBMK, gas-cooled). Slows fast neutrons (2 MeV) to thermal energies (0.025 eV), increases U-235 fission cross-section 580× (thermal neutrons more likely to cause fission).

**Step 141-160: PWR/BWR Reactor Systems and Steam Generation**
**PWR (pressurized water reactor, 65% of reactors):** Primary loop: reactor coolant pumps circulate water through core (15 MPa pressure, 290°C inlet, 325°C outlet, no boiling due to high pressure, saturation temp 345°C at 15 MPa). Flow rate: 15,000-20,000 kg/s. Primary loop contained in reactor pressure vessel (RPV, 5m diameter, 12m tall, 20cm thick forged steel, clad with stainless steel). Hot leg pipes (0.7-0.9m diameter) carry 325°C water to steam generators. **Steam generator:** U-tube heat exchanger (10,000-15,000 tubes, primary water inside tubes, secondary water on shell side). Secondary side: 5-7 MPa, water boils absorbing heat from primary (270-290°C saturation), steam exits 280°C (slightly superheated or saturated). Steam to turbine, condenser, feedwater return (Rankine cycle, same as coal). 4 steam generators (loop design) per reactor (Westinghouse 4-loop, 1,000-1,200 MWe). Primary water never leaves containment (radioactive, activated corrosion products Co-60, tritium H-3). Secondary water non-radioactive (minor leakage through tube defects, <1%). **BWR (boiling water reactor, 20% of reactors):** Single loop, water boils in core (7 MPa, 285°C), steam-water mixture rises (30-40% quality, mass fraction steam), separates in steam separators above core, dry steam to turbine, condenser, feedwater returns to reactor vessel. Simpler (no steam generator), but turbine/condenser radioactive (N-16 activation product, 7-second half-life, decays to stable O-16, turbine shielded, no personnel during operation). **Reactor power:** 1,000-1,600 MWe electrical (3,000-4,800 MWth thermal, efficiency 33-35%, limited by Carnot, T_hot 325°C vs coal 565°C). Large fuel inventory, low power density 100 MW/m³ (vs gas turbine 300 MW/m³), but fuel cost low. Refueling: shutdown every 12-24 months, replace 1/3 to 1/2 of core (fuel burnup 50,000-60,000 MWd/tonne, 4-5% U-235 depletes to 1% fissile). Load-following: capable 50-100% daily cycling, but economically prefer baseload 24/7 (high capital cost $5,000-10,000/kW, low fuel cost $5-10/MWh, capacity factor 90-95%).

**Step 161-175: Hydroelectric Power Generation**
Water stored behind dam (potential energy mgh, mass × 9.8 m/s² × height). Released through penstock (large pipe 3-10m diameter), drives turbine, returns to river. **Dam types:** Gravity dam (concrete/masonry, 50-200m tall, Hoover Dam 221m), arch dam (curved concrete, transfers load to canyon walls), embankment dam (earth/rock fill, largest volume). Reservoir: 0.1-200 km³ storage (Three Gorges 39 km³, Lake Mead 35 km³). **Turbine types:** (1) Pelton wheel (high head 300-2,000m, low flow 1-30 m³/s): water jet hits buckets on wheel periphery (impulse turbine, atmospheric pressure). Efficiency 90-92%. (2) Francis turbine (medium head 30-500m, medium flow 10-500 m³/s): water enters radially, exits axially through runner (reaction turbine, submerged). Efficiency 92-95%. Most common (60% of hydro capacity). (3) Kaplan turbine (low head 2-40m, high flow 50-1,000 m³/s): axial-flow, adjustable pitch blades (propeller turbine). Efficiency 92-94%. Run-of-river, tidal applications. **Generator:** Vertical axis (hydro standard), salient-pole rotor (many poles, 40-200 poles, low speed 60-300 rpm, avoids gearbox). Rating: 50-1,000 MW per unit (Three Gorges 32 × 700 MW + 2 × 50 MW = 22.5 GW). **Power output:** P = ρ g Q H η (water density 1,000 kg/m³, gravity 9.8 m/s², flow Q m³/s, head H meters, efficiency η 0.85-0.93). Example: 100 m head, 200 m³/s, 90% efficiency → 176 MW. **Pumped storage:** Pump water uphill during low demand (night, low electricity price), generate during peak (day, high price). Efficiency 70-85% round-trip (losses: pumping, generation, evaporation). Largest energy storage technology (150 GW global capacity).

**Step 176-185: Solar PV and Wind Power**
**Solar photovoltaic:** Semiconductor p-n junction (silicon, cadmium telluride, perovskite), photon absorbed creates electron-hole pair, built-in electric field separates charges, generates voltage/current. Crystalline silicon: 18-22% efficiency (monocrystalline PERC cells, passivated emitter rear contact), 16-18% (polycrystalline). Thin-film CdTe: 16-19% (First Solar). Perovskite: 25-28% lab (tandem with silicon, commercial pending). Panel: 60-72 cells in series (300-450 W, 1.6-2.0 m², Voc 40-50V, Isc 9-11A). Inverter converts DC to AC (string inverter 2-100 kW, 96-99% efficiency, MPPT maximum power point tracking). Utility-scale solar farm: 50-1,000 MWp (peak power, DC capacity), capacity factor 15-25% (produces 15-25% of peak due to night, clouds, sun angle). **Wind power:** Wind kinetic energy (½ ρ A v³, air density 1.2 kg/m³, swept area A = π r², wind speed v m/s). Turbine extracts fraction (Cp power coefficient, Betz limit 59%, practical 40-50%). Horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT): 3 blades (fiberglass-epoxy composite, 40-80m length), rotor diameter 80-220m (swept area 5,000-38,000 m²). Nacelle: gearbox (rotor 10-15 rpm → generator 1,500-1,800 rpm, ratio 100:1) or direct-drive (low-speed permanent magnet generator, avoids gearbox). Rating: 2-15 MW (offshore 8-15 MW, GE Haliade-X 14 MW). Capacity factor: 25-35% (onshore), 40-55% (offshore, steadier winds). **Grid integration:** Variable generation (solar/wind fluctuate with weather), requires backup (gas turbines, batteries, hydro), or transmission (aggregate over wide area, smooth variability). Inverter-based resources (IBR): solar/wind connect via power electronics (no rotating inertia, grid stability challenge, synthetic inertia algorithms, grid-forming inverters).

**Step 186-195: Transmission, Distribution, and Grid Operations**
**[Transmission lines](transmission-lines):** Generator output stepped up by [transformer](power-transformer) (11-25 kV → 115-765 kV, oil-cooled, 100-500 MVA rating). High voltage reduces current (P = V × I), lowers resistive losses (P_loss = I² R). Transmission voltages: 115 kV (sub-transmission), 230 kV, 345 kV (regional), 500 kV (inter-regional), 765 kV (long-distance USA Eastern Interconnect, 1,500 kV UHVDC China). Conductor: aluminum cable steel reinforced (ACSR, aluminum strands around steel core, 250-1,000 mm² cross-section). Lines: 3-phase AC (3 conductors + ground wires), suspended on lattice steel towers (30-100m tall, span 200-500m). Losses: 2-4% per 1,000 km (conductor resistance, corona discharge). HVDC (high-voltage direct current): 500-800 kV, lower losses (no skin effect, reactive power), long-distance (>500 km), asynchronous interconnections (China ±800 kV UHVDC 3,000 km, 10 GW). **Substations:** Step down voltage (765 → 345 → 115 → 12-35 kV distribution, 3-6 transformation stages). Circuit breakers (interrupt fault currents 40-80 kA, SF₆ gas-insulated or vacuum), disconnect switches, transformers. **Distribution:** 12-35 kV overhead lines on wooden poles (10m tall, 50m span) or underground cables. Distribution transformer (pole-mounted, 25-100 kVA) steps to utilization voltage (120/240V split-phase USA, 230V Europe, 100V Japan). **Grid balancing:** Real-time balance generation = load + losses (mismatch causes frequency deviation ±0.05 Hz tolerance). Automatic generation control (AGC): centralized system sends setpoints to generators (economic dispatch, least-cost generation mix), regulates frequency, interchange. **Reliability:** N-1 criterion (withstand any single outage), redundancy (parallel lines, backup transformers). Blackouts from cascading failures (overload → trip → overload others, Northeast blackout 2003, 50 million affected). Smart grid: advanced metering (AMI smart meters), distribution automation (remote switching, fault detection), demand response (incentivize load reduction).
