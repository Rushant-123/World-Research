# How to Make Ion Implanter

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Applied Materials](/companies/applied-materials)
- [Axcelis](/companies/axcelis)



Semiconductor tool that shoots dopant ions into silicon wafer at high energy (1-400 keV). Creates n-type (phosphorus, arsenic) or p-type (boron) regions for transistors. Precise dose (10¹¹-10¹⁶ ions/cm²) and depth control.

## Process:
[Ion Source](plasma-ion-source) creates plasma of dopant atoms. Extract ions. [Mass Separator](mass-spectrometer-magnet) (magnetic field) selects desired ion species. [Accelerator](high-voltage-accelerator) accelerates ions to target energy. Beam scans across wafer. [Vacuum System](vacuum-pumps) maintains 10⁻⁶ Torr. [Wafer Handler](vacuum-robot) loads/unloads. Implantation dose and energy determine junction depth and doping concentration. After implantation: anneal at 1000°C to activate dopants and repair crystal damage.

Cost: $3-7 million. Throughput: 150-250 wafers/hour. Critical for all transistor fabrication.
