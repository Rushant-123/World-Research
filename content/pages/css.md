# How to Make CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to describe the visual presentation of web pages written in HTML. It was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 and is maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).

## What is it?

A stylesheet language that controls the appearance of HTML elements - colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, animations, and responsive design. CSS separates content (HTML) from presentation (visual styling), allowing the same HTML to be styled differently for different devices or preferences.

## Steps to Make:

1. Start with [HTML Language](html) as the foundation that CSS will style
2. Apply [Programming Language Design](language-design) principles for styling syntax
3. Define the core concepts: selectors, properties, values, and cascading rules
4. Create a specification document defining CSS syntax and behavior
5. Use a [Standards Committee](standards-body) (W3C) to review and approve the specification
6. Define selectors for targeting HTML elements (class, id, element, attribute)
7. Define properties for visual styling (color, font-size, margin, padding)
8. Define the "cascade" - rules for which styles take priority when multiple rules apply
9. Add layout systems (flexbox, grid, positioning)
10. Add responsive design features (media queries)
11. Add animations and transitions
12. Add advanced features (variables, calculations, transforms)
13. Update [Web Browser](web-browser) rendering engines to support CSS parsing
14. Test browser rendering with various CSS rules
15. Create [Technical Documentation](technical-documentation) explaining CSS properties and usage
16. Release the CSS specification as a free, open standard
17. Developers use a [Text Editor](text-editor) to write CSS code
18. Publish example stylesheets and tutorials
19. Evolve the specification (CSS1, CSS2, CSS3, CSS4+ modules)
20. Ensure browser vendors implement features consistently

The result is a free, open standard that works with HTML to create visually styled web pages. CSS files are plain text with .css extension, or CSS can be embedded in HTML. No installation required - just knowledge of selectors, properties, and values.
