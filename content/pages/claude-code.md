# How to Make Claude Code

Claude Code is an AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool that helps with software engineering tasks. It's made by Anthropic and runs on your computer while connecting to cloud services.

## What is it?

An interactive CLI application that allows developers to use Claude AI for coding tasks directly from their terminal. It can read files, write code, execute commands, search codebases, and assist with software development workflows. The tool combines local execution with cloud-based AI processing.

## Steps to Make:

1. Obtain a [Mac Computer](mac) to run the CLI application
2. Connect the Mac to [Electricity](electricity) to power it
3. Set up an [Internet Connection](internet-connection) for cloud access
4. Subscribe to [AWS Bedrock API](aws-bedrock) service for AI model access
5. Use [GitHub](github) to access the Claude Code repository
6. Download the [CLI Software](cli-software) package from Anthropic via GitHub
7. Install the CLI software on your Mac using package managers
8. Configure authentication tokens for AWS Bedrock in environment variables
9. Set up the API connection to the [Claude AI Model](claude-ai-model)
10. Configure settings like model selection, regions, and output preferences
11. Run the `claude` command in your terminal to start the application
12. The CLI connects to AWS Bedrock servers over the internet
13. AWS Bedrock routes requests to Claude AI model running on their infrastructure
14. Responses stream back through the internet connection to your terminal
15. The local CLI handles file operations, command execution, and user interface

The result is an AI assistant running in your terminal that can help write code, debug issues, search files, and perform other development tasks by combining local file access with cloud-based AI reasoning.
