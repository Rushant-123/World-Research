# How to Make Arsenic Dopant

**Market Leader:** [Air Products](/companies/air-products)



Arsenic creates n-type silicon (like phosphorus but heavier atom). Arsenic: 5 valence electrons, donates one. Used when shallow junctions needed (arsenic diffuses slower than phosphorus due to larger atomic size).

## Forms:
**[Arsine](ash3-gas) (AsH₃):** Extremely toxic gas. Decomposes: 2AsH₃ → 2As + 3H₂. Used in ion implantation and MBE (molecular beam epitaxy). Diluted in H₂ (1-10%).

**[Arsenic Metal](arsenic-element):** Solid source for evaporation or sputtering.

Arsenic advantage: Lower diffusivity = better control of shallow junctions (<50nm). Used in advanced CMOS. Concentration: 10¹⁸-10²⁰ atoms/cm³ for source/drain. [Purification](gas-purification) to 99.9999%. Price: $1000-3000/kg (AsH₃ very expensive due to toxicity handling).
