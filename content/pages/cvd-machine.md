# How to Make CVD Machine

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Applied Materials](/companies/applied-materials)
- [Tokyo Electron](/companies/tokyo-electron)



Chemical Vapor Deposition deposits thin films on wafers. Gases decompose on hot wafer surface, forming solid film. Deposits: oxides (SiO₂), nitrides (Si₃N₄), metals (W, Al, Cu), dielectrics. Film thickness: 10nm-10µm.

## Types:
**LPCVD:** Low pressure (0.1-1 Torr), high temperature (600-900°C). Excellent uniformity.
**PECVD:** Plasma-enhanced, lower temperature (200-400°C).
**ALD:** Atomic layer deposition - self-limiting reactions, monolayer control.

[Process Chamber](quartz-chamber), [Heating System](resistive-heaters) (RF or resistive), [Gas Delivery](mass-flow-controllers) with [Precursor Gases](cvd-precursors) (SiH₄, NH₃, WF₆, etc.), [Vacuum System](vacuum-pumps). Cost: $4-8 million.
