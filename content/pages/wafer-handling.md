# How to Make Automated Handling Systems

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Brooks Automation](/companies/brooks-automation)
- [Rorze](/companies/rorze)
- [Yaskawa](/companies/yaskawa)



Fab automation: [Vacuum Robots](wafer-transfer-robots) transfer wafers between equipment. [FOUP Carriers](wafer-carriers) (Front Opening Unified Pods) hold 25 wafers in sealed containers. [AMHS Vehicles](overhead-transport) (Automated Material Handling System) - overhead hoists transport FOUPs between tools. [Control System](fab-automation) tracks every wafer location, schedules moves, optimizes routes.

No human touches wafers - contamination risk too high. Robots position wafers with ±50 micron accuracy. AMHS moves 1000+ wafers/hour through fab. System cost: $50-200M for complete fab automation. Downtime <0.1% - reliability critical. Wafer tracing: barcode/RFID tracks each wafer through 700+ process steps.
