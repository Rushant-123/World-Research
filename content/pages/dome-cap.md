## Quality Control and Final Packaging

The completed speaker dust caps undergo final acoustic property testing to ensure they meet resonance frequency specifications and don't introduce unwanted vibrations. Approved units are counted, packaged in protective foam inserts with moisture barrier bags, and labeled with production batch numbers for traceability. Quality control documentation accompanies each shipment to downstream speaker assembly operations.
