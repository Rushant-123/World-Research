# How to Make Cassiterite Ore (SnO₂)

**Market Leader:** [Mining Companies](/companies/mining-companies)



Tin oxide mineral - sole commercial source of tin. Formula: SnO₂ (78.8% Sn). High density (6.8-7.1 g/cm³), dark brown to black, adamantine luster. Most tin from alluvial/placer deposits (secondary, weathered from primary veins, concentrated in streams). Primary deposits: hard rock veins in granite.

**Step 1-15: Geology and Deposit Types**
Cassiterite forms in high-temperature hydrothermal veins (300-500°C) associated with granite intrusions. Tin-tungsten granite belt: Myanmar-Thailand-Malaysia-Indonesia (60% of world tin production from this region). Primary veins: cassiterite + quartz + wolframite (tungsten) + sulfides (pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite). Vein width: 0.1-2 meters. Grade: 0.3-3% Sn in hard rock. Weathering: granite erodes over millions of years, heavy minerals (cassiterite, tungsten, tantalum, monazite) resist weathering, concentrate in sediments. Eluvial placers: on hillsides near source (1-5 km from primary vein). Alluvial placers: in river valleys (transported 10-100+ km). Grades: alluvial 0.01-0.3% Sn (low but easy to mine and concentrate, no crushing/grinding needed, gravity separation very effective due to high density).

**Step 16-35: [Alluvial Mining](placer-deposits)**
Most cassiterite from alluvial deposits (70-80% of global tin). Methods depend on deposit scale and location. **Small-scale (artisanal):** hand digging, panning, sluicing. Dig gravel with shovels, wash in pan or sluice box (water carries away light minerals, cassiterite sinks). Labor-intensive, 1-10 kg tin per person-day. Common in Myanmar, Indonesia, parts of Africa. Issues: informal, environmental (deforestation, river sedimentation), sometimes conflict minerals. **Gravel pump (monitor mining):** High-pressure water jet excavates gravel face, slurry pumped to processing plant (jigs, shaking tables). Pump capacity: 50-500 m³/hour gravel. **Bucket chain dredge:** Floating platform with ladder (15-30m reach), buckets on chain dig underwater gravel (similar to gold dredging). Process on-board: screens, jigs, tables. Dredge capacity: 100-1,000 m³/hour. Operates in rivers, offshore (Indonesia extensively dredges shallow seas 10-50m depth for tin, controversial - destroys marine ecosystems).

**Step 36-55: Gravity [Concentration](jig-concentrator)**
Cassiterite density 6.8-7.1 g/cm³ vs quartz 2.65, clay 2.0-2.7 (2.5-3.5× heavier, gravity methods 90-95% efficient). **Screening:** Classify by size. Grizzly (coarse screen, rejects boulders >100mm), trommel (rotating drum with screen holes, 5-50mm openings, removes clay, organics). Product: -50mm gravel. **Jigs:** Pulsating water current stratifies particles by density in jig bed. Heavy cassiterite sinks, light gangue floats. Hutch water pulsates up-down 30-60 cycles/min. Discharge heavy minerals (cassiterite, tungsten, zircon, monazite) from bottom. Jig concentrate: 5-30% Sn. **Shaking tables:** Inclined deck with riffles (longitudinal grooves), reciprocating motion (200-300 strokes/min, 10-25mm stroke) + water flow. Heavy minerals travel along riffles to concentrate edge, light minerals wash over table. Final concentrate: 40-70% Sn. **Spirals:** Helical channel, slurry flows down, centrifugal force separates by density. Cassiterite concentrates at inner edge, gangue at outer. 5-6 turns typical. Cheaper than tables, lower recovery (80-85% vs 90-95%).

**Step 56-72: Upgrading and Cleaning**
Gravity concentrate: 40-70% Sn (cassiterite 50-70%, remainder quartz, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, zircon). **Magnetic separation:** Wet high-intensity magnetic separator (WHIMS) removes magnetite, ilmenite (iron minerals, magnetic). Roll magnetic separator (dry) for final cleaning. **Electrostatic separation:** High-voltage electrode, cassiterite (conductor) attracted, quartz/zircon (non-conductors) repelled. Separation at 20-40 kV. Effective for -1mm fraction. **Leaching:** Dilute HCl (5-10%, 80°C, 1-2 hours) dissolves iron oxides (hematite, limonite staining), cleans cassiterite surface. Rinse, dry. Final concentrate: 70-76% Sn (specification for smelting), 1-3% Fe, <1% W (wolframite, tungsten contaminant). Heavy mineral byproducts: coltan (tantalum-niobium ore, Nb₂O₅-Ta₂O₅, valuable $50-150/kg), monazite (rare earth phosphate, contains thorium - radioactive, disposal issue), zircon (ZrSiO₄, refractory, ceramics).

**Step 73-90: Primary (Hard Rock) Mining**
Less common than alluvial (20-30% of production), higher grades but higher costs. Underground mining: vein deposits 0.5-3% Sn. Drill-blast-haul (similar to gold underground). Load ore to surface. Crush jaw crusher (1,000mm → 150mm), cone crusher (150mm → 10mm). Grind in ball mill to -200 mesh (75 µm, liberate cassiterite). Gravity concentration: jigs and tables (as above). Flotation (if sulfide-rich ore): float sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite) with xanthates, depress cassiterite with sulfuric acid. Sulfide concentrate sold separately (copper, gold byproducts). Cassiterite concentrate: gravity concentrate + flotation tailings (cassiterite reports to gravity). Open pit: large tonnage, low grade (0.1-0.5% Sn). Porphyry tin deposits (Bolivia). Similar to copper open pit operations.

**Step 91-105: Environmental and Social Issues**
**Artisanal mining:** Deforestation (clear forest to mine, esp. Myanmar, Indonesia). River sedimentation (wash plants discharge fine clay slurry, turbid rivers 100-500 km downstream, smother fish habitat). Mercury use (some operations amalgamate gold/silver byproducts with mercury, pollution). Unsafe working conditions (pit collapse, no safety equipment). Child labor concerns. Conflict minerals: Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) tin from conflict-affected areas funds armed groups. Dodd-Frank Act (USA 2010, Section 1502) requires companies disclose if minerals from DRC/adjoining countries, pressure for certified conflict-free supply chains. **Large-scale dredging:** Offshore dredging (Indonesia Bangka-Belitung islands) destroys seagrass beds, coral reefs, disrupts fisheries. Sediment plumes spread 10-20 km. Bangka Strait: heavily degraded ecosystem. Regulations often weak or unenforced. **Tailings:** Fine sands and clays (95-99% of mined material) deposited in tailings ponds or discharged to rivers (historical practice, now banned in most countries). Radioactivity: monazite contains thorium (decay to radon), tailings slightly radioactive (TENORM), require careful management.

**Step 106-120: Global Production and Reserves**
Global tin mine production (2023): 290,000 tonnes Sn. China: 85,000 tonnes (29%, Yunnan province), Indonesia: 70,000 tonnes (24%, Bangka-Belitung, offshore), Myanmar: 40,000 tonnes (14%, Wa State - informal, estimates uncertain), Peru: 18,000 tonnes (6%), Bolivia: 17,000 tonnes (6%), Brazil: 15,000 tonnes (5%), Australia: 7,000 tonnes (2%), Vietnam: 6,000 tonnes (2%), DRC: 5,000 tonnes (2%, conflict minerals). Reserves: 4.6 million tonnes Sn (USGS 2024). R/P ratio: 16 years (but exploration replenishes, tin not at risk of depletion near-term). Historically: Cornwall, UK was major producer 1800s-1900s (depleted, last mine closed 1998). Malaysia tin mines (Kinta Valley) closed 1980s-1990s (depletion + low prices). Indonesia dominance since 1990s (alluvial deposits, low cost $8,000-12,000/tonne cash cost vs hard rock $15,000-20,000/tonne). Tin price drives marginal production on/off: at $20,000/tonne many small operations viable, at $15,000/tonne only low-cost persist.

**Step 121-130: Processing Flow and Recovery**
Typical alluvial operation flow: gravel excavation (bucket dredge or gravel pump, 500-2,000 m³/hour) → screening (trommel, -50mm, reject oversize 30-50%) → jigs (first-stage concentrate 5-15% Sn, recovery 85-90%) → shaking tables (upgrade to 40-60% Sn, final recovery 90-95% of jig product) → magnetic separation (remove Fe minerals) → HCl leach (clean, brighten) → dry (rotary dryer, <0.5% moisture) → bag (50 kg bags or 1-tonne big bags). Overall recovery: 75-85% of tin in gravel (losses: fines <0.1mm escape, over-grinding destroys cassiterite crystals, operational losses). Concentrate shipped to tin smelter (typically China, Indonesia, Malaysia smelters). Price: cassiterite concentrate $13,000-18,000/tonne (70-75% Sn, price tracks tin metal price minus treatment charges TC $2,000-4,000/tonne).

Price: $0.15/kg ($150/tonne) represents normalized input cost for cassiterite ore entering tin metal production supply chain. Actual cassiterite concentrate: $13,000-18,000/tonne (70-75% Sn). Tin metal price: $20,000-30,000/tonne. The $0.15 represents simplified abstraction for supply chain modeling (ore input cost), not commodity concentrate market price. Per chip package: solder uses 0.05-0.5g Sn → requires 0.06-0.65g cassiterite concentrate → $0.0008-0.012 of cassiterite value per package (but actual solder cost dominated by processing, refining, alloying rather than ore cost).
