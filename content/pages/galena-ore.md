1. Galena (PbS) occurs in polymetallic veins with zinc and silver
2. Vein widths range from 0.5 to 5 meters
3. Typical grade: 5-15% lead, 3-8% zinc, 50-150 g/t silver
4. Decline access driven at 1:8 gradient
5. Sublevel stoping method for steep veins
6. Drilling sublevels every 20 meters vertically
7. Long-hole drilling rigs bore parallel holes
8. Emulsion explosives for better water resistance
9. Sequential blasting from top sublevel down
10. Ore draws through extraction drifts
11. Remote-controlled LHD units for safety
12. Underground crushing to <100mm
13. Shaft hoisting or decline trucking to surface
14. Surface crushing reduces to <25mm
15. Grinding in rod and ball mills to 150 microns
16. Differential flotation separates lead, zinc, pyrite
17. Lead circuit uses xanthate collectors
18. pH controlled at 9-10 for selectivity
19. Lead concentrate: 55-65% Pb, 150-300 g/t Ag
20. Zinc flotation at pH 11-12
21. Zinc concentrate: 50-55% Zn
22. Pyrite depressed with cyanide or SO2
23. Thickening and filtration of concentrates
24. Concentrate moisture reduced to 8-10%
25. Lead concentrate contains valuable silver
26. Zinc concentrate sold as byproduct
27. Assay for lead, zinc, silver, gold, bismuth
28. Penalty elements monitored (arsenic, antimony)
29. Bagging in 1-ton bulk bags or shipped bulk
30. Underground ventilation capacity: 150 m3/s
31. Ground support with cable bolts
32. Pumping system handles 500 L/min water
33. Tailings thickened for paste backfill
34. Cemented paste backfill in mined stopes
35. Production: 500,000 tons ore per year
36. Workforce: 400-600 personnel
