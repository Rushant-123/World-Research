# How to Make This Website

This website documents supply chains from finished products down to raw materials. It's a static site built with Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## What is it?

A knowledge base that maps how technology products are made, showing the complete path from end products like apps and devices all the way down to natural resources like ores, sand, and trees. Each page explains what something is, what inputs are needed to make it, and step-by-step instructions for assembly or manufacturing.

## Steps to Make:

1. Use [Claude Code](claude-code) AI assistant to help plan and design the site structure
2. Write content in markdown files using a [Mac Computer](mac)
3. Power the Mac with [Electricity](electricity) throughout the development process
4. Connect to the internet to research supply chain information ([Internet Connection](internet-connection))
5. Install [Hugo Static Site Generator](hugo) on the Mac
6. Create the Hugo configuration file (hugo.toml) specifying site settings
7. Design HTML templates for the homepage and individual pages
8. Write CSS styles for clean, Wikipedia-like appearance
9. Create markdown content files with frontmatter for each supply chain item
10. Test the site locally by running `hugo server` command
11. Build the static site with `hugo build` command, generating HTML files
12. Create a GitHub repository for the project
13. Push all site files to GitHub using git commands
14. Enable [GitHub Pages Hosting](github-pages) in the repository settings
15. Configure a custom [Domain Name](domain-registration) to point to the GitHub Pages URL
16. Verify the site is live and accessible on the internet

The result is a static website where visitors can click through hyperlinks to explore how products are made, from the website itself down to the raw materials and processes that enable every component.
