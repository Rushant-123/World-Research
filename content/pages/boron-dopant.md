# How to Make Boron Dopant

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Air Products](/companies/air-products)
- [Voltaix](/companies/voltaix)



Boron creates p-type (positive charge carriers - holes) silicon. Boron has 3 valence electrons vs silicon's 4, creating "hole" that accepts electrons. Used in PMOS transistors, p-wells, and source/drain regions.

## Forms:
**[Boron Trifluoride](bf3-gas) (BF₃):** Gas for ion implantation. Molecular weight 68. Ionize to B⁺ ions, implant into silicon.

**[Diborane](b2h6-gas) (B₂H₆):** Gas for CVD doping. Decomposes on hot wafer: B₂H₆ → 2B + 3H₂. Toxic, pyrophoric (ignites in air).

**Boron Nitride (BN):** Solid source for diffusion doping.

Concentration: 10¹⁵-10²⁰ atoms/cm³ depending on application. [Purification](gas-purification) to remove metals (affect electrical properties). Purity: 99.999-99.9999%. Price: $500-2000/kg depending on form and purity.
