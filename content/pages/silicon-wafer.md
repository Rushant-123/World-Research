# How to Make a Silicon Wafer

A silicon wafer is a thin, circular disc of ultra-pure crystalline silicon used as the substrate for manufacturing computer chips. They're typically 300mm (12 inches) in diameter and less than 1mm thick.

## What is it?

A perfectly flat, mirror-smooth disc cut from a cylindrical ingot of single-crystal silicon. The crystal structure is so pure and uniform that it contains fewer than one impurity atom per billion silicon atoms. This purity is essential because even tiny impurities can ruin the chips built on the wafer.

## Steps to Make:

1. Start with [Purified Silicon](purified-silicon) in polycrystalline form (small chunks)
2. Place the silicon chunks into a [Quartz Crucible](quartz-crucible) - a heat-resistant container
3. Put the crucible inside a [Crystal Growing Furnace](crystal-furnace)
4. Heat the furnace using [Electricity](electricity) to over 1,400°C (2,550°F) to melt the silicon
5. Ask an adult to help as the furnace reaches extremely high temperatures
6. Lower a small "seed" crystal of silicon into the molten pool
7. Very slowly pull the seed crystal upward while rotating it
8. Silicon atoms from the melt attach to the seed in a perfect crystal pattern
9. Continue pulling over 1-3 days to grow a cylindrical ingot about 2 meters long and 300mm diameter
10. Remove the finished ingot and let it cool in a [Cleanroom](cleanroom-facility)
11. Inspect the ingot for crystal defects using X-ray diffraction
12. Grind the outside of the cylinder to a precise diameter
13. Cut off the ends which have crystal irregularities
14. Use a [Diamond Wire Saw](diamond-saw) to slice the cylinder into thin wafers
15. Each cut produces a disc about 0.775mm thick
16. Clean the wafers with [Ultra-Pure Water](ultra-pure-water) to remove sawing debris
17. Use [Polishing Equipment](polishing-equipment) with [Polishing Slurry](polishing-slurry) to smooth one side of each wafer
18. Polish to a mirror finish - the surface must be perfectly flat to within nanometers
19. Clean again with ultra-pure water and chemicals
20. [Fab Workers](wafer-workers) inspect each wafer under intense lighting for defects
21. Package wafers in protective containers to prevent contamination
22. Ship to semiconductor fabrication facilities like TSMC

The result is a perfect substrate ready for chip manufacturing. Any dust, scratch, or impurity will create defects in the chips, so every step must happen in ultra-clean conditions.
