# How to Make a Silicon Wafer

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [TSMC](/companies/tsmc) - 54% share
- [Samsung](/companies/samsung-electronics) - 16% share
- [Intel](/companies/intel) - 8% share



A silicon wafer is a thin, circular disc of ultra-pure crystalline silicon used as the substrate for manufacturing computer chips. They're typically 300mm (12 inches) in diameter and less than 1mm thick.

## What is it?

A perfectly flat, mirror-smooth disc cut from a cylindrical ingot of single-crystal silicon. The crystal structure is so pure and uniform that it contains fewer than one impurity atom per billion silicon atoms. This purity is essential because even tiny impurities can ruin the chips built on the wafer.

## Steps to Make:

**Crystal Growing (Czochralski Process):**
1. Start with [Purified Silicon](purified-silicon) chunks (polycrystalline, 99.9999999% pure)
2. [Fab Workers](wafer-workers) load 100-200 kg of silicon chunks into [Quartz Crucible](quartz-crucible)
3. Place crucible into [Graphite Susceptor](graphite-susceptor) which acts as a heater
4. Lower the assembly into [Crystal Growing Furnace](crystal-furnace) chamber
5. Seal the chamber and pump out air
6. Fill chamber with [Argon Gas](argon-gas) to prevent oxidation
7. Power the furnace with [Electricity](electricity) to heat the susceptor via induction
8. Heat to 1,414°C (melting point of silicon) over 2-3 hours
9. Ask an adult to help as the furnace operates at extremely high temperatures
10. Silicon melts into a glowing liquid pool
11. Carefully lower a [Seed Crystal](silicon-seed-crystal) (small rod of single-crystal silicon) until it just touches the melt
12. The seed has specific crystal orientation (usually <100> or <111>)
13. Begin rotating the seed crystal at 10-20 RPM
14. Slowly pull the seed upward at 1-2 mm per minute
15. Silicon atoms from the melt solidify onto the seed in same crystal orientation
16. Computer controls temperature precisely (±0.1°C) to control crystal diameter
17. Increase pull rate slightly to "neck" the crystal (thin section to eliminate defects)
18. Once defects are eliminated, slow pull rate to grow to target diameter (300mm)
19. Maintain constant diameter by adjusting temperature and pull speed
20. The crucible also rotates in opposite direction to ensure uniform heat distribution
21. Continue for 24-48 hours until ingot reaches 1.5-2.0 meters length
22. Near the end, increase pull speed to taper the crystal end
23. Detach the finished ingot from remaining melt
24. Allow furnace to cool slowly over 12-24 hours to prevent thermal shock
25. Remove the ingot - it weighs 100-200 kg

**Ingot Processing:**
26. Transport ingot to [Cleanroom](cleanroom-facility) (Class 100 or better)
27. Use [X-Ray Diffraction Tool](xray-tool) to map crystal orientation and detect defects
28. Check for dislocations, oxygen content, and resistivity
29. Mark the crystal orientation flat (notch) on the ingot
30. Mount ingot on [Grinding Equipment](cylindrical-grinder)
31. Grind the cylinder to precise diameter (300.00mm ± 0.1mm)
32. This removes surface irregularities and tapers
33. Cut off the seed end and tail end using saw (these have crystal defects)
34. Clean the ingot with [Ultra-Pure Water](ultra-pure-water) and chemicals

**Wafer Slicing:**
35. Mount ingot on [Diamond Wire Saw](diamond-saw) fixture
36. The saw uses [Diamond Wire](diamond-wire) - steel wire embedded with industrial diamond particles
37. Wire moves at high speed (10-20 m/s) while reciprocating back and forth
38. Feed coolant (water + glycol) to prevent overheating
39. Slowly advance the wire through silicon at 0.2-0.5 mm/min
40. Each cut produces a wafer 775 microns thick
41. Wire kerf (material lost to cutting) is only 120-140 microns
42. One 2-meter ingot yields 2,500-3,000 wafers
43. Slicing process takes 6-10 hours for entire ingot
44. Carefully remove each wafer and place in [Wafer Cassettes](wafer-cassettes)

**Wafer Preparation:**
45. Inspect each wafer visually - reject any with cracks or chips
46. Clean wafers with ultra-pure water rinse to remove slurry and particles
47. Load wafers into [Lapping Machine](lapping-machine)
48. Lapping flattens both sides using abrasive slurry (aluminum oxide)
49. This improves thickness uniformity and surface flatness
50. Target thickness after lapping: 725 microns
51. Thickness variation across wafer must be < 2 microns
52. Clean wafers thoroughly to remove lapping residue

**Edge Grinding:**
53. Round the sharp edges of each wafer to prevent chipping
54. Use diamond grinding wheel at high speed
55. Creates slightly beveled or rounded edge profile
56. Prevents edge damage during handling and processing

**Etching:**
57. Etch wafers in [Chemical Etchant](wafer-etchant) (mixture of HF, HNO₃, and acetic acid)
58. This removes surface damage from lapping and slicing
59. Removes 20-30 microns from each surface
60. Ask an adult to help as these chemicals are highly corrosive
61. Rinse thoroughly with [Ultra-Pure Water](ultra-pure-water)

**Polishing:**
62. Load wafers into [Polishing Equipment](polishing-equipment) (chemical-mechanical polishing)
63. Apply [Colloidal Silica Slurry](polishing-slurry) - nanoparticles of SiO₂ in alkaline solution
64. Polish pad rotates while wafer rotates in opposite direction
65. Apply precise downward pressure (controlled to grams)
66. Polish removes 2-5 microns from front surface
67. Chemical reaction + mechanical abrasion creates atomically smooth surface
68. Surface roughness after polishing: < 0.2 nanometers RMS
69. This is smoother than a mirror - perfect at atomic scale
70. Back surface may remain etched (for gettering) or also polished

**Final Cleaning:**
71. Clean wafers in multi-step process:
72. RCA-1 clean: NH₄OH + H₂O₂ + H₂O (removes organic contamination)
73. Rinse with ultra-pure water (18.2 MΩ·cm resistivity)
74. RCA-2 clean: HCl + H₂O₂ + H₂O (removes metal ions)
75. Rinse again with ultra-pure water
76. Spin-dry with nitrogen gas

**Inspection:**
77. Use [Inspection Equipment](wafer-inspection) to examine each wafer
78. Laser surface scanner detects particles (sensitivity to 0.1 micron)
79. Optical inspection checks for scratches, stains, or haze
80. Measure thickness at multiple points across wafer
81. Measure total thickness variation (TTV) - must be < 1 micron
82. Measure bow and warp - wafer must be flat to < 10 microns
83. Check crystal orientation with X-ray diffraction
84. Reject any wafers failing specifications (typically 5-10% reject rate)

**Packaging:**
85. Place accepted wafers into clean [Wafer Cassettes](wafer-cassettes)
86. Each cassette holds 25 wafers with spacing to prevent contact
87. Cassettes are made of ultra-clean polymer
88. Seal cassettes in nitrogen-filled bags to prevent oxidation
89. Package in shock-resistant boxes
90. Ship to semiconductor fabs (TSMC, Intel, Samsung, etc.)

**Quality Specifications:**
- Diameter: 300mm ± 0.2mm
- Thickness: 725-775 microns ± 20 microns
- TTV: < 1 micron
- Bow: < 10 microns
- Front surface roughness: < 0.2 nm
- Particles (>0.12µm): < 10 per wafer
- Metal contamination: < 10¹⁰ atoms/cm²

The entire process from ingot growth to finished wafer takes 3-5 weeks. Modern fabs consume 3-5 million wafers per year. Every step must happen in ultra-clean conditions because a single dust particle can ruin dozens of chips on a wafer.
