## Production Capacity and Economic Considerations

The electrolytic production of fluorine gas is capital intensive due to specialized equipment requirements and extreme material constraints. A typical commercial-scale fluorine plant operates multiple electrolysis cells producing 1,000-3,000 kg of fluorine per day. Cell voltage efficiency and current density directly impact production costs, with electrical energy representing approximately 22% of operating costs. The necessity for continuous operation to maintain nickel passivation layers means plant availability typically exceeds 95% annually. Fluorine's extreme reactivity limits storage capacity and favors production-on-demand models for large consumers. The specialized nature of fluorine production, combined with significant safety and environmental compliance costs, limits the number of global producers to a few major chemical companies with extensive experience in handling reactive halogen gases.
