# How to Make Structural Epoxy Adhesive

A two-part thermoset adhesive that bonds metal, glass, plastic, and composite materials with high strength. Part A (resin) and Part B (hardener) mixed immediately before application. Cures via chemical reaction, forming cross-linked polymer network. Used for permanent structural bonds in MacBook assembly: display hinge reinforcement, chassis stiffening, component mounting. Lap shear strength: 20-35 MPa. Temperature resistance: 120-180°C.

## What is it?

Two-component adhesive system stored separately until use. Part A: epoxy resin (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) with fillers and modifiers. Part B: amine or anhydride hardener. Mix ratio typically 1:1 or 2:1 by volume. Working time (pot life): 5-60 minutes depending on formulation. Cure time: 1-24 hours at room temperature, faster with heat. Fully cured adhesive is rigid, high strength, excellent chemical resistance. Gap filling: 0.1-5mm. Color: gray, black, white, or transparent.
