# How to Make Polishing Slurry

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Cabot Microelectronics](/companies/cabot-microelectronics)
- [DuPont](/companies/dupont)
- [Fujimi](/companies/fujimi)



Abrasive suspension for CMP (chemical mechanical polishing). Contains: nanoparticles, chemicals (pH control, oxidizers, inhibitors, surfactants), water.

## For Silicon Wafer Polishing:
[Colloidal Silica](colloidal-silica) particles (20-100nm), [Chemical Additives](slurry-chemicals) (KOH for pH 10-11, surfactants), [DI Water](ultra-pure-water). Mix in [High-Shear Mixer](high-shear-mixer). [Filter](slurry-filtration) to remove agglomerates. Particle size uniformity critical.

## For Oxide CMP:
Fumed silica particles, pH 10-11, selective etch for oxide vs silicon.

## For Copper CMP:
Alumina or silica abrasives, oxidizer (H₂O₂ or Fe(NO₃)₃), pH 3-5, corrosion inhibitors (BTA), surfactants.

Cost: $50-200/liter depending on application. Selectivity, removal rate, defectivity determine performance. Slurry development is art and science - years of optimization.
