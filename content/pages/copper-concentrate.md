1. Extract copper ore from open pit or underground mine using blasting and excavation

2. Haul ore to primary crusher using 300-ton capacity haul trucks

3. Crush ore in gyratory crusher reducing from 1500mm to <300mm

4. Convey crushed ore to grinding circuit via belt conveyors

5. Grind ore in semi-autogenous (SAG) mill with 10m diameter drum

6. Add water creating slurry at 70-80% solids by weight

7. Discharge SAG mill product through trommel screen separating oversize

8. Return oversize material to SAG mill for re-grinding

9. Pump SAG mill undersize to ball mill for secondary grinding

10. Grind in ball mill achieving P80 of 150 microns (80% passing 150μm)

11. Classify ground slurry in hydrocyclone cluster separating size fractions

12. Return cyclone underflow (coarse) to ball mill recirculating load

13. Forward cyclone overflow (fine slurry) to flotation circuit

14. Condition slurry with lime adjusting pH to 10-11 for optimal flotation

15. Add collector reagent (sodium isopropyl xanthate) at 40-80 g/tonne ore

16. Add frother (MIBC or Dowfroth) at 15-25 g/tonne generating stable froth

17. Feed conditioned slurry to rougher flotation cells (10-20 cells in series)

18. Inject compressed air creating bubbles that attach to hydrophobic chalcopyrite

19. Overflow froth containing copper minerals collecting in launders

20. Achieve rougher concentrate grade of 8-15% Cu with 85-92% recovery

21. Pump rougher concentrate to scavenger flotation recovering additional copper

22. Re-float rougher concentrate in cleaner flotation cells (3-4 stages)

23. Reject pyrite and other gangue minerals reporting to cleaner tailings

24. Produce final concentrate grading 25-35% Cu with overall recovery 88-95%

25. Thicken concentrate slurry in high-rate thickener to 60-70% solids

26. Filter concentrate using ceramic disc filters or pressure filters

27. Achieve final moisture content of 8-10% in filter cake

28. Stockpile concentrate in covered warehouse or load directly to transport

29. Sample concentrate analyzing Cu, Fe, S, Au, Ag, As, Pb, Zn content

30. Blend concentrates from multiple sources achieving consistent smelter feed grade

31. Load concentrate into railcars or ships for transport to copper smelter

32. Ship copper concentrate to smelters where it is roasted, smelted in flash furnace, and converted to blister copper before electrorefining to 99.99% purity cathode copper
