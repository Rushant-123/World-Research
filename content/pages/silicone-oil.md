Silicone oil (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) is manufactured through hydrolysis and polymerization of dimethyldichlorosilane, producing fluids with viscosities ranging from 1 to 100,000 centistokes. These thermally stable, dielectrically excellent fluids serve as thermal interface materials, damping fluids in haptic engines, lubricants for precision mechanisms, and diffusion pump fluids. Shin-Etsu Chemical produces pharmaceutical and electronic-grade silicone oils with controlled molecular weight distributions and ultra-low volatility specifications.

## Manufacturing Process (195 steps)

### Raw Material Preparation (Steps 1-15)

1. Receive dimethyldichlorosilane (Me2SiCl2) in stainless steel tank cars at 99.5% purity minimum
2. Transfer silane through nitrogen-blanketed lines to prevent moisture contact and premature hydrolysis
3. Store in 20,000-liter jacketed storage tanks at 15-25°C with dry nitrogen headspace
4. Monitor for hydrochloric acid formation indicating moisture contamination (max 50 ppm HCl)
5. Prepare deionized water (resistivity >15 MΩ·cm) for hydrolysis reaction at controlled temperature
6. Chill water to 5-10°C to control exothermic hydrolysis reaction rate and temperature spike
7. Add pH buffer (sodium bicarbonate 0.1%) to neutralize HCl and maintain pH 6-7 during reaction
8. Prepare acid catalyst (sulfuric acid 96% or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 0.1-1%) for polymerization
9. Filter catalyst solution through 0.2 μm membrane to remove particulates that affect clarity
10. Prepare chain terminator (trimethylchlorosilane or hexamethyldisiloxane) for molecular weight control
11. Degas all liquid feeds with vacuum at 50 mbar for 30 minutes to remove dissolved oxygen
12. Pre-warm reactor jacket to 60°C for controlled temperature ramp during exothermic reactions
13. Verify reactor cleanliness through conductivity measurement (<1 μS/cm rinse water) and visual inspection
14. Calibrate temperature sensors (±0.5°C accuracy) and pressure transducers (±0.1 bar accuracy)
15. Establish nitrogen purge flow at 5 liters/minute to maintain inert atmosphere throughout process

### Hydrolysis Reaction (Steps 16-35)

16. Charge 5,000 liters of chilled deionized water into glass-lined 10,000-liter reactor vessel
17. Start agitation at 80 RPM with anchor-type impeller to create uniform mixing without vortexing
18. Begin dropwise addition of dimethyldichlorosilane at 50 liters/hour through subsurface sparger
19. Monitor temperature rise from 10°C to target 25°C as exothermic hydrolysis proceeds (ΔH = -150 kJ/mol)
20. Control cooling jacket to maintain 20-30°C by circulating chilled glycol through reactor walls
21. Observe white emulsion formation as cyclic dimethylsiloxane oligomers precipitate from aqueous phase
22. Continue silane addition for 4-6 hours until total 2,500 liters is hydrolyzed with 2:1 water excess
23. Collect hydrochloric acid byproduct in caustic scrubber system (NaOH 20%) to neutralize fumes
24. Maintain pH 6-7 throughout addition by dosing sodium bicarbonate solution to buffer acid formation
25. Increase agitation to 120 RPM after complete addition to emulsify oil phase and improve separation

37. Heat to 80°C with steam jacket while maintaining nitrogen blanket to prevent oxidation
38. Add acid catalyst (sulfuric acid 0.05-0.5% by weight) to initiate ring-opening equilibration
39. Observe viscosity increase as cyclic oligomers open and polymerize into linear PDMS chains
40. Monitor viscosity every 30 minutes using online viscometer to track polymerization progress
41. Target molecular weight determined by desired final viscosity (1 cSt = 800 Da, 100 cSt = 7,500 Da)
42. For low-viscosity oils (1-10 cSt): polymerize 2-4 hours to Mw 1,000-3,000 Da, DP 13-40
43. For medium-viscosity oils (50-100 cSt): polymerize 6-8 hours to Mw 7,000-9,000 Da, DP 93-120
