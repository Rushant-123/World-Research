1. Mine lead-zinc ore from underground workings using drill-and-blast methods

2. Transport ore from stope to surface using skip hoists and haul trucks

3. Stockpile run-of-mine ore in covered storage protecting from weather

4. Sample ore stockpiles analyzing lead content by XRF assay (typical 2-8% Pb)

5. Crush ore in jaw crusher reducing size from 800mm to <150mm

6. Convey crushed ore to semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill

7. Grind ore in SAG mill with steel grinding balls producing -10mm product

8. Transfer SAG mill discharge to ball mill for fine grinding

9. Grind in ball mill achieving 80% passing 75 microns (200 mesh)

10. Pump ground ore slurry to classification cyclones separating oversize

11. Return cyclone underflow to ball mill for re-grinding closed loop

12. Forward cyclone overflow (fine slurry) to flotation circuit

13. Condition ore slurry with pH modifiers (lime) raising pH to 9-10

14. Add collector reagents (xanthates, dithiophosphates) at 20-50 g/tonne

15. Add frother (MIBC, pine oil) at 10-20 g/tonne creating stable bubbles

16. Feed conditioned slurry to lead rougher flotation cells

17. Inject air into flotation cells creating bubble swarm rising through slurry

18. Allow galena (PbS) particles to attach to bubbles forming froth layer

19. Skim lead-rich froth from cell surface using automated paddles

20. Collect rougher concentrate containing 15-30% Pb for cleaning stages

21. Re-float rougher concentrate in cleaner cells rejecting locked particles

22. Repeat cleaning 2-3 times achieving final concentrate grade 60-75% Pb

23. Thicken lead concentrate slurry in paste thickener to 65-75% solids

24. Filter thickened concentrate using pressure filters or filter presses

25. Achieve filter cake moisture content of 8-12% (dry basis)

26. Transfer filter cake to storage bins or directly load into trucks/railcars

27. Sample concentrate for assay measuring Pb, Zn, Fe, S, Ag, Au content

28. Certify concentrate meets smelter purchase specifications (min 50% Pb, penalties for Zn>3%)

29. Load concentrate into covered railcars or trucks for shipment to lead smelter

30. Ship lead concentrate to smelters for production of refined lead metal and recovery of silver byproduct commonly present at 500-2000 g/tonne in galena ores
