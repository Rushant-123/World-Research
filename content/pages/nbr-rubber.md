1. Design Nbr Rubber component based on application requirements and interface specifications

2. Create 3D CAD model defining geometry, features, and critical dimensions

3. Select material appropriate for operating environment: temperature, stress, chemical exposure

4. Specify material grade and condition (annealed, heat treated, etc.) per industry standards

5. Generate manufacturing drawings with dimensional tolerances and surface finish requirements

6. Determine manufacturing process: machining, molding, casting, stamping, or additive manufacturing

7. Source raw material stock: bar, sheet, pellets, or powder depending on process

8. Inspect incoming material verifying material certification and physical properties

9. Set up manufacturing equipment installing tooling and fixtures for component production

10. Program CNC machines or set process parameters based on engineering specifications

11. Load raw material into manufacturing equipment positioning in fixture or chuck

12. Execute primary manufacturing operation forming component to near-net shape

13. Monitor process parameters: temperature, pressure, speed, force ensuring process stability

14. Perform in-process inspection measuring critical features during manufacturing

15. Complete secondary operations: drilling, tapping, deburring, cleaning as required

16. Apply surface treatment if specified: plating, coating, anodizing, heat treatment

17. Control treatment process parameters achieving specified surface properties

18. Rinse and clean components removing process residues and contamination

19. Dry components using forced air or oven preventing water spots and corrosion

20. Inspect finished components using appropriate metrology: calipers, micrometers, gauges, CMM

21. Measure critical dimensions verifying conformance to drawing tolerances

22. Check surface finish using profilometer measuring Ra, Rz roughness parameters

23. Perform functional testing if applicable: fit, force, leak test, electrical test

24. Conduct material testing on sample parts: hardness, composition, coating thickness

25. Sort components by inspection results separating conforming and non-conforming parts

26. Rework or scrap non-conforming components per quality procedures

27. Mark components with part number, revision, and lot code using laser marking or stamping

28. Apply protective coating or bag components preventing corrosion and damage during storage

29. Count and package components in specified quantities (bulk, trays, tubes, reels)

30. Label packages with part number, quantity, lot number, and inspection status

31. Store packaged components in controlled environment: temperature, humidity, cleanliness

32. Maintain traceability records linking components to production batch and raw material lot

33. Prepare quality documentation: certificate of conformance, test reports, inspection data

34. Package components for shipment using appropriate cushioning and moisture barrier

35. Apply shipping labels with destination, handling instructions, and tracking number

36. Ship Nbr Rubber components to assembly plants, equipment manufacturers, and end users for integration into higher-level assemblies and systems
