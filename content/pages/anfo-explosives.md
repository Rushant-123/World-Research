1. Ammonium nitrate manufactured in prill tower
2. Prill size: 1-3mm diameter
3. Porosity: 10-15% for fuel oil absorption
4. AN stored in dry conditions to prevent caking
5. Fuel oil (#2 diesel) delivered in tanker
6. Fuel oil specification: API gravity 30-40
7. Optimal AN:FO ratio is 94:6 by weight
8. Rotary drum mixer or ribbon blender
9. Mixing achieves complete coating of prills
10. Mixed ANFO free-flowing powder consistency
11. Oxygen balance optimized near zero
12. Bulk storage silos with climate control
13. Pneumatic loading into delivery trucks
14. Mobile manufacturing units (MMUs) at mine site
15. MMU produces 20-30 tons per hour
16. Augering directly into blastholes
17. Typical blasthole diameter: 150-300mm
18. ANFO column density: 0.82-0.85 g/cc
19. Not suitable for wet holes (absorbs water)
20. Velocity of detonation: 3,000-4,500 m/s
21. Detonation pressure: 3-5 GPa
22. Energy release: 3.7 MJ/kg
23. Fume class: 1 (low toxicity)
24. Primer cartridge (booster) initiates ANFO
25. Booster typically 450g pentolite
26. Detonator attached to booster
27. Electronic detonators for precision timing
28. Blast timing intervals: 8-100 milliseconds
29. Post-blast NOx fumes below 5,000 ppm
30. Cost advantage over other explosives
31. Transportation as separate components (UN 1942)
32. Mixed product classified as blasting agent
33. Storage magazine requirements per ATF regulations
34. Shelf life: 6 months in dry conditions
35. Moisture >1% reduces performance significantly
