# How to Make Fuel Source

**Market Leader:** [Energy Companies](/companies/energy-companies)



Fossil fuels for power generation. **Coal:** Mined from [Coal Mine](coal-mining), transported by rail/barge. Types: anthracite (highest energy), bituminous, sub-bituminous, lignite. Energy content: 20-30 MJ/kg. Power plant burns pulverized coal.

**Natural Gas:** Extracted from [Gas Well](gas-extraction). Primarily methane (CH₄). Transported via pipeline. Energy content: 38-40 MJ/m³. Burned in gas turbine or boiler. Cleaner than coal - 50% less CO₂ per kWh.

**Oil:** Less common for power generation (expensive). Mainly backup/peaking power.

**Nuclear Fuel:** Uranium enriched to 3-5% U-235. Pellets in fuel rods. Fission releases 80,000,000 MJ/kg (2 million× more than coal).

**Renewable:** Solar/wind/hydro have no fuel cost, but high capital cost.
