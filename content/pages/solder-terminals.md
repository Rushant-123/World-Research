## Quality Assurance Notes

Throughout the manufacturing process, statistical process control (SPC) is maintained with regular sampling and measurement of critical dimensions. All equipment is calibrated on scheduled intervals traceable to NIST standards. Process capability studies are conducted quarterly to ensure Cpk values remain above 1.33 for key characteristics. Operator training and certification programs ensure consistent execution of manufacturing procedures. Material traceability is maintained from raw brass coil through final packaged product using barcode scanning and database tracking systems.

## Environmental and Safety Considerations

The manufacturing process incorporates waste treatment systems for plating bath rinse water, with chemical precipitation and filtration to remove heavy metals before discharge. Plating bath fumes are captured by ventilation hoods and scrubbed to remove acid vapors. Personal protective equipment including gloves, safety glasses, and protective aprons are required in chemical processing areas. Automated material handling reduces operator exposure to repetitive motion injuries. Energy efficiency is optimized through heat recovery from drying ovens and efficient press drive systems.
