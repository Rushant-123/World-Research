# How to Make a Photomask

Glass plate with chrome patterns defining integrated circuit layout. Used in photolithography - UV/EUV light shines through mask onto silicon wafer. Pattern transfers to photoresist. Advanced chips require 50-100 mask layers. Each mask costs $50,000-200,000. Precision: features down to 13nm (EUV masks).

## Process:
[Quartz Substrate](synthetic-quartz) coated with [Chrome Layer](chromium-metal). Pattern written with [E-Beam Writer](electron-beam-lithography) - electron beam selectively exposes resist. Develop and etch chrome. [Inspect](mask-inspection) for defects - single 50nm defect can ruin chips. Apply [Pellicle](protective-pellicle) - transparent film protecting mask from particles. Store in [Cleanroom](cleanroom-facility). Complete mask set for advanced chip: $5-10 million.
