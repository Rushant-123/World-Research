# How to Make Zinc Metal

Zinc - essential metal for galvanizing steel (corrosion protection, 50% of demand), die casting (automotive, hardware, 17%), brass/bronze alloys (15%), zinc oxide chemicals (rubber, ceramics, 10%), batteries (alkaline, zinc-air, 3%), other uses (5%). Extracted primarily from sphalerite ore (ZnS, zinc sulfide). Roast-leach-electrowinning (RLE) process produces 99.995% pure zinc (Special High Grade SHG). Global production: 13.6 million tonnes/year. China: 6.5 Mt (48%), Peru: 1.5 Mt (11%), Australia: 1.4 Mt (10%), USA: 0.76 Mt (6%), India: 0.75 Mt (6%), Mexico: 0.68 Mt (5%).

**Step 1-10: Sphalerite Ore Mining and Geology**

[Sphalerite ore](sphalerite-mining): zinc sulfide (ZnS, 67% Zn theoretical), primary zinc mineral, forms in hydrothermal vein deposits, sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) deposits, volcanic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits. Crystal structure: cubic (sphalerite) or hexagonal (wurtzite polymorph, rare). Color: yellow to brown to black (iron content causes darkening, (Zn,Fe)S solid solution up to 26% Fe substitution). Associated minerals: galena PbS (lead, 40-60% of zinc deposits contain Pb co-product), pyrite FeS₂ (iron sulfide, often 5-30% of ore), chalcopyrite CuFeS₂ (copper, some deposits), barite BaSO₄, fluorite CaF₂, calcite CaCO₃ (gangue). Major deposits: Red Dog Alaska (world's largest, SEDEX type, 17% Zn + 5% Pb, open pit, Teck Resources), Rampura Agucha India (14% Zn + 2% Pb), Mount Isa Australia (underground), Antamina Peru (6% Zn + 1% Cu polymetallic), Irish Midlands (Lisheen, Galmoy, closed but historic producers). Ore grades: 3-15% Zn typical (average 8-10%), high-grade >15% Zn (Red Dog 17%, rare), low-grade 3-6% Zn (larger tonnage). Underground mining: shaft access (500-1,500m depth), sublevel caving or longhole stoping, drill-blast-muck cycle, ore hoisted to surface. Open pit: dragline or hydraulic excavator, haul trucks (100-240 tonne), bench mining (15m benches). Run-of-mine (ROM) ore to crusher.

**Step 11-25: Crushing and Grinding**

Primary crushing: jaw crusher or gyratory crusher (ROM ore 500-1,000mm → 150-200mm). Secondary crushing: cone crusher (150-200mm → 20-40mm). Tertiary crushing: cone or short-head crusher (20-40mm → 5-15mm). Stockpile crushed ore (blend for consistent feed grade). Grinding: semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill (15-30 MW power, 8-12m diameter, ore + steel balls tumble, 80% passing 1-3mm) followed by ball mill (2-8 MW, steel balls 20-100mm, grind to 80% passing 75 microns). Cyclone classifiers: separate fine particles (overflow to flotation) from coarse (underflow back to ball mill, closed circuit). Grinding slurry: 30-40% solids, pH controlled to 10-11 with lime Ca(OH)₂ addition (depresses pyrite flotation, optimizes sphalerite recovery). Grind size critical: too coarse (<70% -75µm) = poor liberation (zinc locked in gangue), poor recovery. Too fine (>95% -75µm) = over-grinding, slimy flotation, lower grade concentrate, higher energy cost.

**Step 26-42: Froth Flotation - Zinc Concentrate**

Separate sphalerite from gangue using density and surface chemistry differences. **[Flotation cells](flotation-cells):** Mechanical cells (3-20m³ volume, impeller agitates slurry, air injection creates bubbles) or column cells (tall vertical vessels 8-15m, air sparger at bottom, countercurrent slurry/bubble flow). Feed slurry (30-40% solids, 8-10% Zn) enters rougher flotation bank (4-8 cells in series). **Collectors:** Xanthates (potassium amyl xanthate KAX, sodium isopropyl xanthate SIPX, 30-80 g/tonne ore) adsorb on sphalerite surface, render hydrophobic. Mechanism: xanthate anion (R-O-CS₂⁻) chemisorbs on zinc-rich sites, organic tail (-O-R chain) extends into water, repels water. **Frothers:** Methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC, 10-30 g/tonne) or pine oil, stabilize bubble-particle aggregates, prevent bubble coalescence. **Activators:** Copper sulfate CuSO₄ (100-500 g/tonne) activates sphalerite flotation by adsorbing Cu²⁺ on ZnS surface (Cu²⁺ + ZnS → CuS layer on surface, enhances xanthate adsorption, especially for iron-rich sphalerite which floats poorly without activation). **Depressants:** Sodium cyanide NaCN (20-100 g/tonne, highly toxic) depresses pyrite FeS₂ flotation (prevents iron sulfide contamination), also depresses sphalerite if overdosed (fine dosage control critical). Zinc sulfate ZnSO₄ or sodium metabisulfite Na₂S₂O₅ depress oxidized minerals. pH control: lime to pH 10-11 (depresses pyrite, activates sphalerite). **Flotation sequence:** Rougher flotation (recover 75-85% Zn in froth, concentrate grade 30-45% Zn), rougher tailings to cleaner flotation. Cleaner flotation (2-3 stages, reprocess rougher concentrate, reject middlings, final concentrate 50-58% Zn). Scavenger flotation (treat rougher tailings, recover additional 5-10% Zn, lower grade product recycled). Overall recovery: 85-93% of zinc in ore recovered to concentrate. Final concentrate: 52-58% Zn, 30-35% S, 1-4% Fe, 1-3% Pb (lead reports to zinc concentrate if present, separated later or tolerated), <8% SiO₂, 0.05-0.2% Cd (cadmium always present with zinc, toxic, must remove in refining).

**Step 43-58: Lead-Zinc Separation (if Pb present)**

Many zinc ores contain lead (galena PbS). Separate by differential flotation. **Lead flotation first:** Adjust pH to 7-9 (less lime, neutral to slightly alkaline), add xanthate collectors (preferential for galena at lower pH), float lead concentrate (60-75% Pb, 3-8% Zn contamination) in rougher-cleaner circuit. Depress sphalerite with zinc sulfate ZnSO₄ (500-2,000 g/tonne, Zn²⁺ ions adsorb on sphalerite, hydrophilic coating prevents flotation). **Zinc flotation second:** Raise pH to 10-11 (add lime), activate sphalerite with copper sulfate CuSO₄ (200-800 g/tonne, overcomes previous depression), add more xanthate, float zinc concentrate (50-58% Zn, <2% Pb). Tailings (gangue, pyrite, depressed by cyanide) to tailings dam. Result: two separate concentrates (lead conc. to lead smelter, zinc conc. to zinc smelter/roaster). Dewatering: thickeners (concentrate slurry 20-30% solids → 50-65% solids, flocculant aids), then pressure filters or vacuum disc filters (65% solids → 8-12% moisture, filter cake). Dry if needed: rotary dryer or fluidized bed (reduce moisture to 5-8%, prevents caking during transport/storage).

**Step 59-75: Roasting - Convert ZnS to ZnO**

Sphalerite (ZnS) insoluble in sulfuric acid leaching. Roast to zinc oxide (ZnO) which dissolves readily. **[Fluidized bed roaster](fluidized-bed-roaster):** Vertical cylindrical furnace (6-10m diameter, 15-25m tall), refractory-lined. Feed concentrate (50-55% Zn, 8-10% moisture) via pneumatic conveyor into bed. Fluidizing air (oxygen-enriched, 25-50% O₂ or pure O₂ in modern plants) injected from bottom through distributor plate (30-60 m/s gas velocity). Concentrate particles suspended in upward gas stream (fluidized, behaves like boiling liquid), intimate gas-solid contact, rapid heat/mass transfer. **Roasting reactions:** ZnS + 1.5O₂ → ZnO + SO₂ (primary, highly exothermic ΔH = -441 kJ/mol). Also: 2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂. Temperature: 900-1,000°C (autogenous, sulfide combustion releases heat, no external fuel needed, excess heat removed by steam generation in waste heat boilers). Residence time: 30-90 seconds (flash roasting). **Products:** Calcine (zinc oxide, exits top in gas stream, cyclone separators collect fine ZnO dust 1-50 microns, 55-65% Zn as ZnO). Off-gas: 8-14% SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), balance N₂, O₂, CO₂, H₂O vapor. Dust carryover: electrostatic precipitators (ESP, 99.5-99.9% capture efficiency) collect calcine fines. **SO₂ conversion:** [Sulfuric acid](sulfuric-acid) plant (contact process): cool gas to 400-450°C, pass through vanadium pentoxide V₂O₅ catalyst beds (4-5 stages, 2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃), absorb SO₃ in 98% H₂SO₄ (SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄). Produces 1.8-2.2 tonnes 98% H₂SO₄ per tonne Zn (co-product, critical for acid leaching step, closed-loop acid balance). Tail gas: <0.1% SO₂ (stack emission limits, scrubbers remove residual SO₂ with lime or caustic).

**Step 76-92: Leaching - Dissolve ZnO in Sulfuric Acid**

Calcine (ZnO + minor ZnFe₂O₄, ZnS unreacted) dissolved in sulfuric acid. Two-stage leaching: neutral leach then hot acid leach. **Neutral leach (first stage):** Mix calcine with spent electrolyte (dilute H₂SO₄ from electrowinning, 40-60 g/L H₂SO₄, pH 4.5-5.5) in agitated tanks (6-10m diameter, 8-12m tall, mechanical stirrers, 60-90 minutes residence). Reactions: ZnO + H₂SO₄ → ZnSO₄ + H₂O (zinc sulfate, soluble). Temperature: 40-50°C (exothermic dissolution, control by cooling coils). Neutral leach dissolves 85-90% of zinc oxide. Residue contains: zinc ferrite ZnFe₂O₄ (insoluble in neutral pH, 10-20% of Zn in calcine, from high-iron sphalerite), unreacted ZnS (1-3%, incomplete roasting), SiO₂ (silica gangue), PbSO₄ (lead sulfate, galena oxidized to PbSO₄ during roasting, insoluble, reports to residue - convenient lead removal), precious metals (Ag, Au traces, remain in residue). **Hot acid leach (second stage):** Treat neutral leach residue with fresh concentrated [sulfuric acid](sulfuric-acid) (93-98% H₂SO₄, diluted to 25-35% in process) at 90-95°C for 2-4 hours. Reactions: ZnFe₂O₄ + 4H₂SO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 4H₂O (zinc ferrite dissolves, releases iron). Dissolves additional 5-10% Zn. Combined leach solution: 120-160 g/L Zn, 2-5 g/L Fe³⁺, 0.5-1.5 g/L Cu, 0.3-0.8 g/L Cd, 0.1-0.3 g/L Co, 80-120 g/L H₂SO₄ free acid, pH 2-3. Total Zn recovery to solution: 92-97%.

**Step 93-110: Solution Purification - Remove Impurities**

Electrolyte must be ultra-pure (Zn²⁺ only, <0.001 ppm Cu/Co/Ni/Fe³⁺ for high-quality electrowinning). **Iron removal:** Add calcine (ZnO) + limestone (CaCO₃) to leach solution at 90-95°C. Reactions: Fe³⁺ + 3OH⁻ → Fe(OH)₃ ↓ (ferric hydroxide precipitates as red-brown gelatinous solid, "jarosite" process or "goethite" process). Jarosite precipitation: 3Fe³⁺ + 2SO₄²⁻ + M⁺ + 6H₂O → MFe₃(SO₄)₂(OH)₆ ↓ + 6H⁺ (M = Na, K, NH₄, basic ferric sulfate, crystalline, easier to filter/settle than amorphous hydroxide). Add sodium hydroxide or ammonia as M⁺ source. Goethite precipitation: Fe³⁺ + 2H₂O → FeO(OH) ↓ + 3H⁺ (goethite, denser, preferred for environmental stability). Precipitate settles in thickeners (2-4 hours), filter (pressure filters), jarosite/goethite residue to tailings or landfill (contain Fe 25-40%, also Pb, Ag, As, Hg impurities from ore, hazardous, must stabilize). Filtrate: <0.1 g/L Fe. **Copper-cadmium-cobalt removal:** Add zinc dust (fine Zn powder, 1-3 kg per tonne Zn, made by distillation or atomization) to purified solution at 40-50°C for 30-90 minutes. Cementation reactions: Cu²⁺ + Zn → Cu + Zn²⁺ (copper cements out as metallic sponge). Cd²⁺ + Zn → Cd + Zn²⁺ (cadmium). Co²⁺ + Zn → Co + Zn²⁺ (cobalt). Ni²⁺ + Zn → Ni + Zn²⁺ (nickel). Mechanism: galvanic displacement (Zn more active, reduces noble metals). Cement cake: filter, wash, smelt to recover Cu, Cd (cadmium recovered as byproduct, $2-5/kg, 15,000 tonnes Cd/year globally, used in NiCd batteries, pigments, coatings, but toxic). Final purified electrolyte: 130-150 g/L Zn as ZnSO₄, 120-150 g/L H₂SO₄, <0.001 ppm Cu, <0.0005 ppm Co, <0.02 ppm Cd, <0.001 ppm Fe³⁺, pH 1.5-2.0.

**Step 111-135: Electrowinning - Deposit Pure Zinc Cathodes**

Electrolysis of purified zinc sulfate solution produces metallic zinc at cathode. **[Electrowinning cells](zinc-electrowinning):** Large concrete tanks (12m × 4m × 1.8m deep), polymer or rubber lining (acid-resistant), 40-60 cells in electrowinning tankhouse. Electrolyte: 130-150 g/L Zn²⁺, 120-150 g/L H₂SO₄, circulate continuously (pumped from cell to cell, series flow or parallel manifold, 5-10 m³/h flow rate per cell). Temperature: 35-40°C (heating coils or heat exchangers, maintain optimal viscosity/conductivity). **Anodes:** Lead-silver alloy (Pb-1%Ag or Pb-0.75%Ag-0.5%Ca, cast plates 1m × 1.2m × 6-8mm, 30-40 kg each). Silver addition prevents corrosion (pure lead forms insulating PbSO₄ layer, Ag maintains conductivity). Anode reaction: 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ (oxygen evolution, no lead dissolves). 30-45 anodes per cell. **Cathodes:** Aluminum starter sheets (1m × 1.2m × 1-3mm, 99.7% Al, commercial purity). Aluminum chosen because zinc doesn't adhere strongly (easy stripping after deposition). Alternative: titanium or stainless steel blanks (reusable, higher capital cost). 30-45 cathodes interleaved with anodes, spacing 100-120mm. **DC power:** Rectifiers (AC grid power → DC, silicon controlled rectifiers SCR or thyristor, 95-98% efficiency). Current: 400-600 A/m² current density (higher = faster deposition but rougher surface, lower quality), 3.0-3.6V per cell (thermodynamic 2.35V for Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn at cathode plus 1.23V for O₂ evolution at anode = 3.58V, overpotentials reduce to 3.0-3.6V practical). Total current per cell: 10-20 kA. Series connection: 40-60 cells × 3.2V = 130-190V DC bus, 10-20 kA (2-4 MW per electrowinning circuit). Power consumption: 3,000-3,400 kWh per tonne Zn (50-60% of zinc production cost, largest operating expense). **Cathode reaction:** Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Zn (zinc deposits on aluminum cathode, metallic, crystalline). Current efficiency: 88-92% (side reaction: hydrogen evolution 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂ at cathode 8-12%, unavoidable due to high overpotential for zinc deposition, hydrogen gas bubbles evolve, collected and vented). Deposition time: 24-48 hours (zinc layer grows to 2-4mm thick, 40-60 kg per cathode, depends on current density). Electrolyte spent: Zn²⁺ consumed (150 g/L → 50-60 g/L), H₂SO₄ increases (120 g/L → 170-190 g/L, acid regenerated at anode 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺). Spent electrolyte returns to leaching (neutral leach step, close loop).

**Step 136-152: Cathode Stripping and Melting**

Remove cathodes from cells (overhead crane, automated systems in modern plants). Rinse cathodes (deionized water spray, remove adhering electrolyte, prevent contamination). **Stripping:** Place cathodes vertically, use stripping machine (mechanical peeler with rollers or hydraulic press, peel zinc sheet from aluminum starter). Zinc sheet: 1m × 1.2m × 2-4mm, 40-60 kg, flexible. Aluminum starter cleaned (caustic wash if oxidized, removes zinc residues) and returned to cells (reuse 200-500 cycles before replacement due to corrosion/warping). Zinc cathode purity: 99.99-99.995% Zn (SHG Special High Grade 99.995%, HG High Grade 99.99%). Impurities: <10 ppm Pb, <10 ppm Cd, <5 ppm Fe, <3 ppm Cu, <50 ppm total impurities. **Melting furnace:** Induction furnace (medium frequency 500-1,000 Hz, graphite or ceramic crucible, 10-30 tonne capacity) or reverberatory furnace ([natural gas](natural-gas) or fuel oil burner, brick-lined hearth). Load zinc cathode sheets (stack in furnace). Melt at 450-550°C (zinc melting point 419.5°C, superheat 30-130°C ensures fluidity). Inert atmosphere or reducing atmosphere (prevent excessive oxidation, zinc burns readily Zn + ½O₂ → ZnO, forms dross). Hold at 500-520°C for 30-60 minutes (homogenize composition). **Drossing:** Skim zinc oxide dross (gray scum) from surface (forms despite precautions, 0.5-2% of melt weight). Dross contains 70-85% Zn (recycle to leaching or roasting). **Fluxing (if needed):** Add ammonium chloride NH₄Cl (0.01-0.05%, fluxing agent, reduces dross, cleans melt surface). Chlorine gas evolution (ammonia + heat → N₂ + HCl, aggressive but effective).

**Step 153-168: Casting - Ingots and Jumbo Blocks**

Cast molten zinc into commercial forms. **Continuous casting (modern method):** Molten zinc flows from furnace through launder (refractory-lined trough) to casting wheel (rotating water-cooled mold, horizontal or vertical wheel, 2-4m diameter). Zinc solidifies in mold cavities (4-6 kg ingots, rectangular 350mm × 90mm × 50mm or trapezoidal "jumbo" 40-50 kg, 1,000mm × 350mm × 150mm). Mold rotates, solidified ingots eject onto conveyor, air or water spray cooling. Production rate: 5-15 tonnes/hour per casting machine. **Traditional casting (batch):** Pour molten zinc from ladle into cast iron molds (25-50 kg ingots, sow molds or pig molds). Cool in air (30-60 minutes), demold, stack. Labor-intensive, slower, but simpler equipment. **Ingot stamps:** Emboss producer brand, grade (SHG, HG), lot number, weight on ingot surface (traceability, quality assurance, LME registered brands traded on London Metal Exchange). **Inspection:** Visual (smooth surface, no cracks/voids), weight (±2% tolerance), chemical analysis (ICP-OES or XRF, verify impurities <10 ppm Pb, Cd, Fe). ASTM B6 specification: SHG 99.995% min, HG 99.90% min. **Packaging:** Bundle ingots on wooden pallets (1-2 tonnes per pallet), steel strapping, shrink wrap or weather-resistant cover. Store dry warehouse (zinc oxidizes slowly in humid air forming white zinc hydroxide Zn(OH)₂ patina, cosmetic issue but doesn't affect metallurgical use).

**Step 169-183: Zinc Alloy Production - Zamak Die Casting Alloys**

Pure zinc too soft (tensile strength 120 MPa, elongation 5-10%, easily deforms). Alloy for structural applications. **Zamak alloys (Zn-Al-Cu-Mg):** Zamak 3 (95.8% Zn, 4% Al, 0.1% Cu, 0.04% Mg), Zamak 5 (95% Zn, 4% Al, 1% Cu, 0.04% Mg). Alloying: melt SHG zinc (450-480°C), add aluminum ingots (melting point 660°C, dissolve slowly, stir with graphite paddle, 15-30 minutes), add copper (as Cu-Zn master alloy or pure Cu shot), add magnesium (reactive, add last, burns easily, press below surface). Hold at 450-480°C for 30-60 minutes (homogenize). Sample, analyze (OES spectrometer, ±0.05% accuracy). Adjust composition (add pure Zn to dilute if over-alloyed, add Al/Cu/Mg if under). Cast into ingots (10-20 kg for die casting supply) or transfer molten to die casting machines. **Zamak properties:** Tensile strength 280-330 MPa (Zamak 3), hardness 80-100 HB, excellent castability (low melting point 385-390°C, high fluidity, fills thin sections <1mm), dimensional stability, good surface finish (chrome plating, painting). **Uses:** Automotive (door handles, locks, fuel system components, 40% of die castings), hardware (hinges, knobs, locks, 25%), electronics (housings, connectors, heat sinks, 15%), plumbing (faucets, valves, 10%), toys/consumer goods (10%). Die casting process: inject molten Zamak into steel mold at 650-850°C (hot chamber die casting, 0.5-3 seconds fill time, 10-60 seconds cycle), eject part, trim flash. Precision: ±0.05mm tolerance, surface finish Ra 1-3 microns.

**Step 184-195: Applications, Market, and Economics**

**Galvanizing (50% of zinc demand, 6.8 Mt/year):** Coat steel with zinc for corrosion protection (sacrificial anode, zinc corrodes preferentially to steel). Hot-dip galvanizing: clean steel (acid pickling, flux), immerse in molten zinc bath (445-465°C, 1-5 minutes), withdraw (zinc coating solidifies 50-150 microns thick, crystalline spangled surface Fe-Zn intermetallics). Applications: construction (structural steel, roofing, rebar), automotive (body panels, chassis, before 1980s), transmission towers, guardrails, fencing. Electroplating: plate thin zinc (5-25 microns) from alkaline zincate or acid zinc sulfate bath (automotive fasteners, small parts, less durable than hot-dip but precise thickness control). Zinc coating life: 20-50 years in rural environments, 5-15 years in industrial/marine (chloride accelerates corrosion). **Brass and bronze (15%, 2 Mt/year):** Brass (Cu 55-95%, Zn 5-45%, yellow alloys, plumbing, fittings, musical instruments, ammunition casings). Cartridge brass (70Cu-30Zn), admiralty brass (70Cu-29Zn-1Sn for marine hardware), high-brass (65Cu-35Zn for cold working). Bronze (Cu-Sn primary, but some Zn-containing bronzes like manganese bronze 58Cu-39Zn-1Sn-1Fe-1Al, strong castings). **Zinc oxide ZnO (10%, 1.4 Mt/year):** Produced by burning zinc vapor (Zn + ½O₂ → ZnO, French process) or leaching zinc ores. White pigment (paints, less common since TiO₂ dominates), rubber vulcanization activator (5-10 phr ZnO in tire compounds, activates sulfur cross-linking, critical), ceramics (glazes, varistors, piezoelectrics), pharmaceuticals (zinc oxide ointment, sunscreen, astringent). **Zinc chemicals:** Zinc sulfate ZnSO₄ (agriculture fertilizer, Zn micronutrient for crops, 0.5 Mt/year), zinc chloride ZnCl₂ (flux, batteries, wood preservative), zinc stearate (mold release, lubricant). **Batteries:** Alkaline batteries (Zn anode, MnO₂ cathode, KOH electrolyte, 50+ billion/year, 250,000 tonnes Zn), zinc-air (hearing aids, military, high energy density), zinc-carbon (legacy, declining). Emerging: rechargeable zinc-air, zinc-ion batteries (research, safer than lithium). **Market price:** $1,800-3,500/tonne (2010-2024 range), recent $2,500-3,200/tonne. LME zinc futures: trading volume 150,000 tonnes/day. Cost structure: mining/milling 30%, roasting 10%, leaching/purification 15%, electrowinning (electricity) 30%, overhead/labor 10%, other 5%. Energy: 3,200-3,800 kWh per tonne Zn (50-60% electricity for electrowinning, 20% thermal for roasting/leaching, 20% mining diesel, 10% other). Carbon footprint: 2.5-3.5 tonnes CO₂e per tonne Zn (electricity dominates, coal-powered smelters 3-4 t CO₂/t Zn, hydro/renewable 1.5-2.5 t). Reserves: 250 Mt Zn (USGS), R/P ratio 18 years (but recycling + exploration extend). Recycling: 30% of supply from scrap (galvanized steel, die casting scrap, brass, zinc dross, secondary smelters refine to 98-99.5% Zn, lower purity than primary but adequate for galvanizing/alloying). Growth: 2-3% per year (driven by steel demand in emerging markets, galvanizing for infrastructure, die casting for lightweight automotive components).
