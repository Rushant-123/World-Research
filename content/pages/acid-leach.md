1. Crushed ore fed to agitated leach tanks
2. Ore ground to 80% passing 75 microns
3. Sulfuric acid added at 10-50 g/L concentration
4. Temperature maintained at 40-90°C
5. Oxygen or air sparging for oxidation
6. Metal sulfides oxidized to metal sulfates
7. Copper: CuS + 2O2 + H2SO4 → CuSO4 + S + H2O
8. Zinc: ZnS + 2O2 → ZnSO4
9. Nickel and cobalt similarly oxidized
10. Residence time: 4-24 hours
11. Multiple tanks in series for staged leaching
12. pH controlled at 1.5-3.0
13. Oxidation-reduction potential monitored
14. Agitator speed: 40-80 RPM
15. Rubber or polymer tank linings
16. Temperature control via steam injection or heat exchange
17. Pregnant leach solution (PLS) contains dissolved metals
18. Typical PLS: 2-10 g/L copper or nickel
19. Solid-liquid separation via thickeners
20. Counter-current decantation (CCD) circuit
21. Three to six thickener stages
22. Wash water added at final stage
23. Clarified PLS to solvent extraction or electrowinning
24. Leach residue to tailings
25. Acid consumption: 20-100 kg H2SO4 per ton ore
26. Metal recovery: 85-95%
27. Residue neutralized with lime
28. Neutralized tailings to storage facility
29. Off-gas scrubbing for SO2 removal
30. Process control via online analyzers
31. XRF or atomic absorption for metal content
32. Automated pH and ORP control
33. Tank inspection for corrosion
34. Agitator maintenance every 6 months
35. Safety: acid handling procedures
36. PPE: face shields, acid-resistant gloves
37. Emergency eyewash and shower stations
38. Spill containment and neutralization materials
