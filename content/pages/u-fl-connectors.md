U.FL connectors are ultra-miniature coaxial RF connectors developed by Hirose Electric for high-frequency signal transmission in compact electronic devices. With dimensions of only 2.6mm x 2.3mm x 1.0mm, these snap-on connectors are widely used for internal antenna connections in laptops, smartphones, tablets, and wireless modules. They provide reliable 50-ohm impedance matching up to 6 GHz while maintaining low insertion loss and excellent VSWR characteristics.
