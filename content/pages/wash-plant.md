## Quality Control

Throughout manufacturing, dimensional inspections verify structural alignment within ±5mm tolerances. Screen media tension is tested to ensure uniform particle separation. Pump performance curves are validated through flow and pressure testing. Hydrocyclone separation efficiency is verified through particle size analysis. Welding on pressure vessels undergoes non-destructive testing including radiography or ultrasonic inspection. Control systems undergo factory acceptance testing before shipment. Final commissioning includes water testing without ore, followed by gradual ramp-up to full production capacity. Operators receive training on normal operation, troubleshooting, and maintenance procedures to ensure long-term reliable performance.
