# How to Make Chip Packaging

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Tsmc](/companies/tsmc)
- [Samsung Electronics](/companies/samsung-electronics)
- [Intel](/companies/intel)



Protects silicon die, provides electrical connections, dissipates heat.

**[Package Substrate](organic-substrate):** Multi-layer PCB (4-8 layers) with fine pitch traces. Connects die pads to [BGA Solder Balls](bga-solder-balls) on bottom.

**[Molding Compound](epoxy-molding-compound):** Epoxy resin with silica filler. Encapsulates die. Protects from moisture, mechanical stress. CTE matched to silicon (prevents cracking).

**[Die Attach](thermal-adhesive):** Thermal adhesive or solder bonds die to substrate. Conducts heat.

**[Bond Wires](gold-wire):** 25µm gold or copper wires connect die pads to substrate. Wire bonding: 5-10 bonds/second. Flip-chip alternative: solder bumps, no wires.

Package types: QFN (Quad Flat No-leads), BGA (Ball Grid Array), LGA (Land Grid Array), CSP (Chip Scale Package).
