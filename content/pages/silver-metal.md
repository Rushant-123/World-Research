- [Pan American Silver](/companies/pan-american-silver)



Silver (Ag) is a precious white metal with the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of all metals. Primarily recovered as a byproduct from lead, copper, and gold refining (70% of production), with 30% from primary silver mines. Used in electronics, solar panels, jewelry, and industrial catalysts.

## What is it?

High-purity silver metal (99.9-99.99% Ag) produced through electrolytic refining and the Parkes desilverization process. Silver has unique properties: electrical conductivity 6.3×10⁷ S/m (best of all metals), thermal conductivity 429 W/m·K, reflectivity >95% for visible light, antimicrobial properties. Global production: 27,000 tonnes/year, with Mexico (23%), China (14%), Peru (13%) as top producers.

## Steps to Make:

**Silver Sources and Geology:**
1. Primary silver deposits: epithermal veins (volcanic-hosted, 200-1,000 g/t Ag), polymetallic Ag-Pb-Zn deposits (50-300 g/t)
2. Silver minerals: argentite/acanthite (Ag₂S, 87% Ag), pyrargyrite (Ag₃SbS₃, 60% Ag), native silver (metallic Ag, rare)
3. Byproduct silver: in galena/PbS (100-5,000 ppm Ag), sphalerite/ZnS (50-500 ppm), chalcopyrite/CuFeS₂ (10-100 ppm)
4. Major silver provinces: Mexican Silver Belt (Fresnillo, Zacatecas), Polish Copper Belt (KGHM), Peruvian Andes (Cerro de Pasco)
5. 70% of global silver is byproduct from lead-zinc, copper, and gold mining operations
6. Primary silver mines: underground vein mining, cut-and-fill or shrinkage stoping methods
7. Ore grades declining: historical 500-1,000 g/t, modern 50-300 g/t, requiring more ore processing

**Lead-Silver Concentrate Processing (Primary Pathway):**
8. Receive [Lead Concentrate](lead-concentrate) from flotation: 50-70% Pb, 1,000-5,000 g/t Ag (1-5 kg Ag per tonne)
9. Concentrate also contains 5-15% Zn, 1-3% Cu, 0.1-0.5% Au, plus As, Sb, Bi impurities
10. Typical concentrate moisture: 8-10%, dry before smelting to 1-2% in rotary dryer at 150°C
11. Blend concentrates from multiple sources to achieve consistent feed composition
12. Sample and assay each batch: fire assay for precious metals, ICP-OES for base metals
13. Store in silos with nitrogen purge to prevent sulfide oxidation and spontaneous combustion

**Sintering of Lead Concentrate:**
14. Feed dried concentrate onto Dwight-Lloyd sintering machine: moving grate 3m wide × 50m long
15. Mix concentrate with 15-20% recycled sinter return fines, 5-8% limestone flux, 3-5% coke breeze
16. Layer mixture 300-500mm deep on grate, ignite top surface with natural gas burners at 1,000°C
17. Draw air through bed from below, combustion front propagates downward over 20-30 minutes
18. Sulfide oxidation reactions: 2PbS + 3O₂ → 2PbO + 2SO₂ (exothermic, releases heat)
19. Temperature in combustion zone: 1,200-1,400°C, partially melts and fuses particles
20. Lead sulfide converts to lead oxide (PbO), iron to hematite (Fe₂O₃), zinc partially volatilizes
21. Product: porous sinter (agglomerated chunks), 30-50% Pb as PbO, 800-3,000 g/t Ag
22. SO₂ off-gas: 8-15% concentration, captured in acid plant to make sulfuric acid (2-3 tonnes H₂SO₄ per tonne Pb)
23. Sinter strength: 80-120 kg compressive strength, suitable for blast furnace charge
24. Break large sinter into 20-80mm lumps, screen fines for recycling

**Blast Furnace Smelting:**
25. Charge blast furnace with sinter (40%), lump lead concentrate (20%), coke (15%), recycled slag (10%), limestone flux (10%), scrap (5%)
26. Blast furnace: vertical shaft 3-4m diameter × 15-20m tall, refractory-lined steel shell
27. Charge from top via skip hoist, materials descend by gravity as lower material melts and taps
28. Inject preheated air (400-600°C) with oxygen enrichment (25-30% O₂) from tuyeres at furnace base
29. Coke combustion: C + O₂ → CO₂, then CO₂ + C → 2CO (reducing gas, endothermic, consumes heat)
30. Temperature profile: 1,200°C at tuyere zone, 900°C mid-shaft, 400°C at top
31. Lead oxide reduction: PbO + CO → Pb + CO₂ (occurs at 400-900°C in mid-shaft)
32. Metallic lead melts (melting point 327°C) and drips down through coke bed
33. Silver in feed: Ag₂S decomposes to metallic Ag at >800°C, dissolves 100% in molten lead
34. Lead bullion collects in hearth at furnace bottom, density 11.3 g/cm³, temperature 900-1,000°C
35. Slag forms from silica (SiO₂), iron oxide (FeO, Fe₃O₄), lime (CaO), zinc oxide (ZnO)
36. Slag composition: 20-25% SiO₂, 15-20% FeO, 15-20% CaO, 15-20% ZnO, 5-10% Al₂O₃
37. Slag floats on lead (density 3.2-3.5 g/cm³), contains <0.5% Pb, <20 g/t Ag (good recovery)
38. Tap lead bullion every 4-6 hours from bottom taphole into 10-tonne ladles
39. Tap slag continuously or batch from slag notch 50cm above metal level
40. Bullion composition: 95-98% Pb, 0.5-2.0% Ag (5-20 kg Ag per tonne), 0.1-0.5% Cu, 0.05-0.2% Au, plus Sb, As, Bi, Sn
41. Slag to zinc fuming furnace: recover zinc oxide by carbothermic reduction with coal at 1,200°C
42. Furnace operates continuously, throughput 500-1,500 tonnes concentrate per day
43. Off-gas treatment: scrub particulates in venturi scrubbers, capture CO in thermal oxidizer

**Lead Bullion Refining - Softening (Remove Copper, Antimony, Arsenic):**
44. Transfer molten bullion (900-1,000°C) to softening kettle: cylindrical cast iron vessel, 30-50 tonnes capacity
45. Cool to 400-450°C with external air cooling, maintain gentle stirring with rotating paddle
46. Add elemental sulfur powder at 1-2% by weight of bullion (500-1,000 kg sulfur per 50-tonne batch)
47. Sulfur reacts with copper: Cu + S → CuS (copper sulfide, insoluble, floats as dross)
48. Also reacts with antimony and arsenic: 2Sb + 3S → Sb₂S₃, 2As + 3S → As₂S₃
49. Dross composition: 40-60% Cu as CuS, 10-20% Sb₂S₃, 5-10% As₂S₃, 20-30% PbS, some Ag (0.5-2%)
50. Skim dross from surface with perforated ladle, accumulate 1-2 tonnes dross per 50 tonnes bullion
51. Dross sent to copper smelter for copper and silver recovery
52. Hold at 400°C for 2-4 hours, test copper content: target <0.01% Cu
53. Repeat sulfur addition and skimming if necessary until specification met

**Parkes Desilverization Process - Zinc Addition:**
54. Cool softened bullion to 500-520°C in kettle with slow stirring
55. Add molten [Zinc Metal](zinc-metal): 1.5-2.0% by weight of bullion (750-1,000 kg Zn per 50 tonnes Pb)
56. Zinc and lead are immiscible, form two liquid phases at this temperature
57. Silver solubility in zinc: 300 times higher than in lead at 500°C (thermodynamic distribution)
58. Stir vigorously for 30-60 minutes: high-speed paddle (60-100 RPM) disperses zinc throughout lead
59. Silver transfers from lead phase to zinc phase: equilibrium reached after 45-90 minutes stirring
60. Gold also transfers to zinc phase: Au solubility in zinc >> Au in lead
61. Stop stirring, allow phases to separate by gravity over 2-4 hours
62. Zinc-silver alloy floats to surface: zinc density 6.6 g/cm³ (liquid at 500°C) vs lead 10.7 g/cm³
63. Cool slowly to 370-390°C over 6-12 hours: zinc-silver crust solidifies at surface
64. Zinc crust composition: 8-15% Ag, 0.1-0.5% Au, 10-20% Pb, balance Zn (70-80%)
65. Skim zinc crust with hand rakes or mechanical skimmer, typical yield 2-3 tonnes crust per 50 tonnes bullion
66. Residual lead in kettle: now contains 0.05-0.1% Ag (50-90% silver removed in first Parkes pass)

**Second and Third Parkes Treatments:**
67. Reheat desilverized lead to 500°C, add fresh zinc (1-1.5% by weight)
68. Repeat stirring, settling, cooling, and skimming process
69. Second crust: 5-10% Ag (lower grade), 1-2 tonnes per 50 tonnes Pb
70. Third Parkes treatment: add 0.5-1.0% zinc, final pass to reduce silver to <0.005% Ag in lead
71. Third crust: 3-6% Ag, smaller quantity (0.5-1 tonne)
72. Combine crusts from multiple batches for zinc retorting: typical accumulation 10-20 tonnes crust
73. Final desilverized lead (soft lead): 99.94-99.97% Pb, <0.005% Ag, <0.01% Cu, trace Sb/As/Bi
74. Soft lead applications: battery grids, cable sheathing, radiation shielding (silver removal essential for proper alloying)
75. Optional: further refine to 99.99% Pb by Betts electrolytic process (H₂SiF₆ + H₂PbF₆ electrolyte)

**Zinc Retorting - Distillation:**
76. Charge zinc-silver crust into horizontal retort furnace: cast iron cylinder 4m long × 1.5m diameter
77. Retort holds 5-10 tonnes of crust per batch, load through top hatch when cool
78. Seal retort, connect condenser tubes to capture zinc vapor
79. Heat externally with [Natural Gas](natural-gas) burners, temperature ramp: 50°C/hour to avoid thermal shock
80. Zinc vaporization begins at 750°C (zinc boiling point 907°C, but appreciable vapor pressure at 750°C)
81. Heat to 1,100-1,200°C, hold for 8-12 hours under vacuum (10-50 mbar) or inert atmosphere (nitrogen purge)
82. Zinc vaporizes: liquid Zn → Zn(g), vapor travels through condenser tubes
83. Condenser: water-cooled cast iron tubes, zinc vapor condenses to liquid zinc at 600-700°C
84. Collect molten zinc in receiver pots, yield 70-85% of zinc in crust (balance lost as oxide, trapped in residue)
85. Recovered zinc: 98-99.5% purity, recycle to Parkes process
86. After retorting: residue in retort cools over 24-48 hours, open and extract solid cake
87. Retort residue (Parkes cake): 300-600 oz/tonne Ag (30-60% Ag), 10-50 oz/tonne Au (1-5% Au), 5-15% Pb, 1-5% Zn, 0.5-2% Cu
88. Residue mass: 1-2 tonnes per 10 tonnes of crust charged (90% mass removal as zinc vapor)

**Cupellation - Fire Refining of Parkes Cake:**
89. Transfer retort residue to cupellation furnace: reverberatory or rotary furnace with oxidizing atmosphere
90. Melt residue at 900-1,000°C in shallow hearth lined with bone ash or magnesia (porous refractory)
91. Blow air across molten metal surface, lead oxidizes: 2Pb + O₂ → 2PbO (litharge, yellow liquid oxide)
92. Litharge absorbs into porous cupel or is skimmed off surface, lead concentration decreases over time
93. Base metals oxidize: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO, 2Zn + O₂ → 2ZnO, oxides dissolve in litharge
94. Silver and gold resist oxidation (noble metals): remain as liquid metal droplets
95. Cupellation endpoint: "brightening" - bright metallic surface appears when all lead oxidized (<0.1% Pb)
96. Process time: 4-8 hours depending on batch size and lead content
97. Product: doré metal buttons (85-95% Ag, 5-15% Au, <1% Pb, <0.5% Cu)
98. Cast doré into anode bars: 150-200 kg anodes, 1m × 0.5m × 30mm, for electrolytic refining
99. Doré assay: fire assay for Ag and Au, ICP for base metal impurities, typical 87-93% Ag, 7-12% Au

**Electrolytic Refining Setup:**
100. [Electrolytic Cells](electrorefining-cell): polypropylene or PVC-lined concrete tanks, 1.5m × 3m × 1.2m deep
101. Electrolyte preparation: dissolve [Silver Nitrate](silver-nitrate) (AgNO₃) in deionized water to 50-80 g/L Ag⁺
102. Add [Nitric Acid](nitric-acid) (HNO₃): 20-40 g/L free acid, pH 0.5-1.0 (highly acidic prevents precipitation)
103. Electrolyte temperature: 40-50°C maintained with immersion heaters or steam coils
104. Temperature control critical: higher temp increases conductivity but reduces current efficiency
105. Install anodes: suspend doré bars (85-95% Ag) on copper hangers, 20-30 anodes per cell
106. Anode spacing: position vertically with 50-70mm gaps between electrodes
107. Install cathodes: pure silver starter sheets (1mm thick, 99.99% Ag) or stainless steel blanks
108. Cathode preparation: pickle in dilute nitric acid to clean, rinse thoroughly
109. Electrode arrangement: alternate anode-cathode-anode-cathode, typical 25 anodes + 26 cathodes per cell
110. Total electrode area: 40-60 m² per cell (both sides of cathodes counted)

**Electrolytic Refining Operation:**
111. Connect anodes to positive DC bus bar, cathodes to negative bus bar
112. Apply current: 150-250 A/m² current density based on cathode area
113. Voltage: 2.5-3.5 V per cell (includes ohmic drop in electrolyte, electrode overpotentials)
114. Series configuration: 50-100 cells in series, powered by 200-300 V DC rectifier
115. Total current: 10,000-20,000 amperes through series string
116. Power consumption: 0.2-0.4 kWh per kg of silver refined (relatively low compared to base metals)
117. At anode (oxidation): Ag → Ag⁺ + e⁻, silver dissolves into electrolyte
118. Silver dissolution rate: 0.8-1.2 kg per m² per day (depends on current density)
119. Gold does not dissolve: Au oxidation potential +1.5 V >> Ag +0.8 V, remains solid
120. Gold accumulates as anode slime: black particles drop to cell bottom
121. Copper (if present): dissolves as Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻, but plates poorly (removed by bleeding electrolyte)
122. Lead impurities: form insoluble PbO₂ at anode, falls as slime
123. At cathode (reduction): Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag, pure silver plates onto cathode surface
124. Silver deposit: fine-grained crystalline structure, bright white appearance
125. Current efficiency: 95-98% (some current lost to water electrolysis, impurity reactions)
126. Cathode growth rate: 0.8-1.0 kg per m² per day
127. Refining period: 5-10 days to grow cathode from 1mm to 10-15mm thick (15-20 kg per cathode)

**Cathode Harvesting and Melting:**
128. Monitor cathode thickness daily, harvest when 10-15mm thick (prevents excessive weight, dendrite formation)
129. Switch off current, lift cathode hangers from cell with overhead crane
130. Rinse cathodes in deionized water spray to remove electrolyte (prevent nitrate contamination)
131. Strip silver from starter sheet: bend cathode, crystalline silver flakes off cleanly
132. If stainless steel blanks used: dissolve steel in nitric acid, recover silver crystals by filtration
133. Collect silver crystals in stainless steel trays, dry at 80-100°C in hot air oven
134. Weigh dried crystals, typical yield 95-97% of theoretical (based on coulombs passed)
135. Transfer silver crystals to melting furnace: induction furnace (50-500 kg capacity) or gas-fired crucible furnace
136. Charge crystals into graphite crucible at room temperature to prevent thermal shock
137. Heat to 1,000-1,050°C (silver melting point 962°C), crystals melt over 30-60 minutes
138. Add flux: borax (Na₂B₄O₇, 0.5-1% by weight) and soda ash (Na₂CO₃, 0.5%) to absorb residual impurities
139. Deoxidize: add charcoal chips or carbon powder (0.1%), produces CO gas that reduces dissolved oxygen
140. Stir molten silver with graphite rod to homogenize and release gas bubbles
141. Skim dross from surface: flux absorbs copper oxide, lead oxide, forms slag layer
142. Hold at 1,020-1,040°C for 15-30 minutes (ensure complete melting and homogenization)

**Casting Silver Products:**
143. Prepare casting molds: cast iron or graphite molds for bars, preheated to 200-300°C

145. Silver bar sizes: 1 kg (small), 5 kg, 15 kg, 30 kg (standard), LBMA Good Delivery (750-1,100 troy oz / 23-34 kg)
146. Cooling: bars solidify in 10-30 minutes depending on size, remove from molds after 1-2 hours
147. Quench in water if rapid cooling desired (but may cause surface oxidation, tarnishing)
148. For granules/shot: pour molten silver through perforated plate into water bath, forms 1-10mm spheres
149. Granules cool rapidly, minimize oxidation, used for jewelry casting, chemical applications
150. For powder: chemical precipitation (silver nitrate + reducing agent) or electrolytic powder (low current density, <10 µm)
151. Stamp bars with: refiner name/logo, serial number, gross weight (kg or troy oz), fineness (999 or 9999)
152. LBMA Good Delivery marking requirements: four stampings on top face, approved assayer hallmark

**Quality Testing and Assay:**
153. Sample each casting lot: drill samples from bars or take granule samples
154. Fire assay: cupel 10-50 g silver sample with lead, quantify gold content (reports as ppm Au)
155. ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry): dissolve sample in nitric acid, measure all impurities
156. Four-nines silver specification (99.99% Ag): <30 ppm Cu, <20 ppm Pb, <10 ppm Fe, other elements each <5 ppm
157. Three-nines silver (99.9% Ag): <500 ppm Cu, <200 ppm Pb, <100 ppm other impurities (lower grade, less demanding)
158. Measure electrical conductivity: 6.3 × 10⁷ S/m at 20°C for pure silver (impurities reduce conductivity)
159. Issue certificate of analysis: silver content (%), gold content (ppm), impurities (ppm), density, lot number
160. Store refined silver in sealed containers with desiccant to prevent tarnishing (silver reacts with atmospheric H₂S)

**Anode Slime Recovery:**
161. Periodically clean cells: every 3-6 months when slime accumulation reaches 50-100 kg per cell
162. Drain electrolyte, pump slime slurry from cell bottom (slime density 5-8 g/cm³ settles well)
163. Filter slime: plate-and-frame filter press, wash with water to remove silver nitrate
164. Dried slime composition: 30-50% Au, 5-15% Ag, 10-20% PbO₂, 5-10% Cu, selenium, tellurium traces
165. Roast slime at 500-600°C in air: decompose selenides and tellurides, volatilize Se and Te (collect in baghouse)
166. Leach roasted slime with dilute sulfuric acid: dissolves copper, zinc, some lead (CuO + H₂SO₄ → CuSO₄ + H₂O)
167. Filter: residue now 60-80% Au, 10-25% Ag, <5% base metals
168. Smelt residue with fluxes (borax, silica, soda ash) at 1,100-1,200°C: produces gold-silver alloy button
169. Cast alloy into anodes, electrorefine in gold cells (sulfuric acid + HCl electrolyte) to separate Au and Ag
170. Gold cell: gold deposits at cathode as 99.99% Au, silver stays in solution or forms AgCl precipitate
171. Recover silver from gold refining electrolyte by precipitation with NaCl: Ag⁺ + Cl⁻ → AgCl↓ (white precipitate)
172. Reduce AgCl with zinc dust or smelt with soda ash and carbon: AgCl + Na₂CO₃ + C → Ag + NaCl + CO₂

**Byproduct Silver from Copper Refining:**
173. Copper electrolytic refining: blister copper anodes (98-99% Cu, 200-1,000 g/t Ag) in CuSO₄ electrolyte

178. Leach copper with H₂SO₄, then leach silver with dilute HNO₃: Ag + 2HNO₃ → AgNO₃ + NO₂ + H₂O
179. Precipitate silver: add NaCl to silver nitrate solution, forms AgCl precipitate
180. Smelt AgCl with soda ash and carbon at 1,000°C: yields crude silver 95-98% Ag
181. Refine by electrolysis (same process as primary silver) to 99.99% Ag
