# How to Make Silver Metal

Precious metal - best electrical and thermal conductor of all metals. Uses: electronics (conductors, contacts, solder), photovoltaics (solar cells), industrial catalysts, mirrors, jewelry, coins, antibacterial agents. Global production: 27,000 tonnes/year. Primary silver mines: 30%, byproduct from lead-zinc, copper, gold mines: 70%.

**Step 1-12: [Silver Ore](silver-ore) Geology and Mining**
Silver occurrence: (1) Native silver (metallic Ag, rare, high-grade 50-90% Ag). (2) Sulfide ores (most common): argentite/acanthite (Ag₂S, 87% Ag), pyrargyrite (Ag₃SbS₃, 60% Ag), tetrahedrite ((Cu,Ag)₁₂Sb₄S₁₃, 15-30% Ag). (3) As trace element in base metal ores: galena (PbS with 100-5,000 ppm Ag), sphalerite (ZnS with 50-500 ppm Ag), chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂ with 10-100 ppm Ag). Primary silver deposits: epithermal veins (volcanic-hosted, high-grade 200-1,000 g/t Ag, narrow veins), polymetallic deposits (Ag-Pb-Zn, 50-300 g/t Ag), porphyry coppers (low Ag 1-10 g/t but large tonnage). Mining: underground vein mining (cut-and-fill, shrinkage stoping, 100-1,000 tonnes/day), open pit (large polymetallic or porphyry deposits, 10,000-200,000 tonnes/day).

**Step 13-28: Concentration by [Froth Flotation](froth-flotation)**
Crush and grind ore to 70-90% passing 200 mesh (75 µm) - liberates silver minerals from gangue. Flotation: silver sulfides are naturally hydrophobic, float readily with xanthate collectors (potassium amyl xanthate, 20-100 g/tonne ore). Frothers: MIBC, pine oil (10-30 g/tonne). pH: alkaline 8-10 (sodium carbonate or lime). Depressants: sodium cyanide (0.1-0.5 kg/tonne) depresses pyrite, improves selectivity. Silver floats with lead-zinc sulfides (galena, sphalerite) - bulk concentrate. Separate Pb and Zn by differential flotation: depress sphalerite with zinc sulfate, float galena first. Then activate sphalerite with copper sulfate, float separately. Pb concentrate: 50-70% Pb, 1,000-5,000 g/t Ag (silver reports with lead). Zn concentrate: 50-60% Zn, 100-500 g/t Ag. Cu concentrate: 20-30% Cu, 50-200 g/t Ag. Recovery: 85-95% of silver in ore to concentrates. For native silver or oxide ores: cyanide leaching (Ag + 2CN⁻ + ½O₂ + H₂O → Ag(CN)₂⁻ + 2OH⁻, dissolve silver, precipitate with zinc dust).

**Step 29-45: Smelting of Lead-Silver Concentrate**
Most silver recovered from lead smelting (silver follows lead in pyrometallurgy). [Blast furnace](blast-furnace) or ISA smelt furnace: charge lead concentrate + coke + silica flux + recycled materials. Temperature: 900-1,100°C. Reducing atmosphere (CO from coke combustion). Reactions: PbS + O₂ → PbO + SO₂. PbO + C → Pb + CO (lead reduced to metal). Ag₂S + heat → 2Ag + S (silver sulfide decomposes, metallic silver dissolves in molten lead - forms lead bullion). Iron and silica form slag: FeO + SiO₂ → FeSiO₃ (floats on bullion). Tap bullion from bottom: 95-98% Pb, 0.5-2% Ag, 0.1-0.5% Cu, 0.05-0.2% Au, traces Sb, As, Bi, Zn. Slag contains <0.01% Ag (good recovery). SO₂ gas: capture in sulfuric acid plant (makes H₂SO₄, 2-3 tonnes per tonne of lead produced).

**Step 46-62: Desilverization of Lead Bullion - Parkes Process**
Lead bullion contains 0.5-2% silver - extract by Parkes process (exploits low solubility of silver in liquid zinc). Add molten zinc to lead bullion (1.5-2% Zn by weight of bullion) at 400-500°C. Stir vigorously for 30-60 minutes. Cool to 370-390°C. Silver has 300× higher solubility in zinc than in lead - transfers to zinc phase. Zinc-silver crust floats on lead (zinc is less dense, 7.1 g/cm³ vs lead 11.3 g/cm³). Skim crust (contains Zn + Ag + Au + some Pb). Composition: 8-15% Ag, 0.1-0.5% Au, 10-20% Pb, remainder Zn. Repeat process 2-3 times (adds more zinc, skims more crust) to reduce silver in lead to <0.005%. Desilverized lead: sell as soft lead (99.94-99.99% Pb) or further refine (Betts electrolytic refining to 99.995-99.999% Pb).

**Step 63-78: Zinc-Silver Crust Processing**
Retort zinc-silver crust: heat in retort (cast iron or steel vessel) to 1,100-1,200°C under vacuum or inert gas. Zinc vaporizes (bp 907°C), condenses in condenser (recover, recycle to Parkes process). Silver and gold remain as solid cake (sp 300-600 oz/tonne Ag, 10-50 oz/tonne Au, "Parkes retort residue"). Cupellation: refine retort residue by oxidation. Heat in cupellation furnace (air blown across surface of molten metal) at 900-1,000°C. Lead and base metals oxidize: 2Pb + O₂ → 2PbO (lead oxide, litharge). PbO liquid absorbs in porous cupel (magnesia or bone ash) or volatilizes. Silver and gold resist oxidation (noble metals), remain as liquid buttons. Cupellation endpoint: bright surface (no oxide film). Product: doré metal (85-95% Ag, 5-15% Au, <1% Pb, Cu). Cast into anodes for electrolytic refining.

**Step 79-95: [Electrolytic Refining](silver-refining) - Silver Cells**
Electrorefine doré anodes to 99.99% pure silver (four-nines fine). Electrolytic cell: polypropylene or PVC tank, 1m × 2m × 1m deep. Electrolyte: silver nitrate (AgNO₃, 50-80 g/L Ag⁺) + nitric acid (HNO₃, 20-40 g/L free acid), temperature 40-50°C. Anodes: cast doré metal bars, 1m × 0.5m × 30mm, 150-200 kg each (85-95% Ag). Suspend 20-30 anodes. Cathodes: thin pure silver starter sheets (1mm thick) or stainless steel plates. Spacing: 50-70mm between electrodes. DC current: 150-250 A/m² current density, 2.5-3.5 V per cell. Cells in series: 50-100 cells, 10-20 kA total. At anode (oxidation): Ag → Ag⁺ + e⁻. Silver dissolves into electrolyte. Gold doesn't dissolve (gold is more noble, higher oxidation potential), falls to bottom as anode slime (recover by separate process). Copper, lead (if present): dissolve but plate poorly or precipitate. At cathode (reduction): Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag. Pure silver plates onto cathode as crystalline deposit. Current efficiency: 95-98%. Time: 5-10 days to plate 15-20kg silver per cathode.

**Step 96-110: Cathode Processing and Product Forms**
Remove cathodes, strip silver crystals from starter sheet. Rinse with water, dry. Melt in gas or induction furnace at 1,000-1,050°C (silver mp 962°C). Flux: borax and soda ash (absorb impurities). Deoxidize: add charcoal or wood (produces CO, reduces dissolved oxygen). Skim dross. Test purity: fire assay or ICP-MS. Spec: 99.99% Ag min (four-nines), <0.003% Cu, <0.002% Pb, other impurities each <0.001%. Cast into product forms: (1) Bars (1-30 kg, 99.99% Ag, stamped with serial, weight, fineness, refiner mark). LBMA (London Bullion Market Association) Good Delivery bars: 750-1,100 troy ounces (23-34 kg), 99.9% min purity. (2) Granules (shot, 1-10mm spheres, for jewelry, chemical applications, made by pouring molten silver through sieve into water). (3) Wire (for electronics, bonding wire - draw from cast rod). (4) Powder (<10 µm, for conductive pastes, catalysts - made by chemical precipitation or electrolytic powder).

**Step 111-125: Byproduct Silver from Copper Smelting**
70% of silver production is byproduct. Copper concentrate smelting: concentrate (CuFeS₂ with 50-200 g/t Ag) → flash smelting → matte (Cu₂S-FeS, silver reports 100% to matte). Converting: blow matte with oxygen, oxidize FeS and Cu₂S → blister copper (98.5% Cu, 200-1,000 g/t Ag, silver concentrates in copper). Electrolytic copper refining: blister copper anodes in CuSO₄-H₂SO₄ electrolyte. Copper dissolves and plates at cathode (99.99% Cu). Silver doesn't dissolve, falls as anode slime along with gold, selenium, tellurium. Anode slime: 10-30% Ag, 5-15% Au, 20-30% Cu, 10-20% Se, 5-10% Te, remainder Pb, Ni, As. Process slime: roast to volatilize selenium and tellurium (Se and Te boil at 685°C and 988°C). Leach copper with sulfuric acid. Residue: Ag-Au-rich (50-70% Ag, 10-25% Au). Smelt to doré metal, electrorefine as above.

**Step 126-140: Industrial Applications and Demand**
Silver demand (2023): 27,000 tonnes. **Industrial:** 50% (13,500 tonnes). Electronics: 6,500 tonnes (solder - SAC alloys contain 1-4% Ag, conductors, multilayer ceramic capacitors MLCC, membrane switches). Photovoltaics: 3,500 tonnes (solar cells use silver paste for front-side electrodes, 100-120 mg Ag per cell, 6-8 g per 300W panel). Brazing alloys: 1,000 tonnes (silver-copper-zinc alloys for HVAC, automotive, aerospace joints). Catalysts: 1,000 tonnes (ethylene oxide production, formaldehyde production). **Jewelry:** 25% (6,800 tonnes), primarily sterling silver (92.5% Ag, 7.5% Cu). **Investment:** 15% (4,000 tonnes), bars, coins (American Eagle, Canadian Maple Leaf, Mexican Libertad). **Photography:** 5% (1,350 tonnes), silver halide film and paper (declining, digital photography replaced most applications, but specialty film persists). **Silverware:** 5% (cutlery, hollowware, declining use).

**Step 141-155: Market, Price, and Economics**
Silver price: $15-30/troy oz ($480-965/kg) over 2010-2024, average $20/oz ($640/kg). Price drivers: gold correlation (silver moves with gold, 70-80% correlation), industrial demand (electronics, solar), investment flows (ETFs, coins, bars), mining supply. Silver-gold ratio: 50-90 (i.e., 50-90 oz silver = 1 oz gold, mean revert 60-70). Production cost: $10-18/oz ($320-580/kg) for primary silver mines (all-in sustaining cost AISC). Byproduct silver: $5-10/oz cost (credited against copper/lead/zinc costs). Reserves: 550,000 tonnes (USGS 2024). R/P ratio: 20 years (but recycling 15%, new deposits). Major producers: Mexico 6,300 tonnes/year (23%), China 3,800 tonnes (14%), Peru 3,500 tonnes (13%), Chile 1,400 tonnes (5%), Russia 1,400 tonnes (5%), Australia 1,300 tonnes (5%), Poland 1,300 tonnes (5%), USA 1,000 tonnes (4%). Supply: mine 27,000 tonnes + recycled scrap 4,000 tonnes = 31,000 tonnes total. Demand: 27,000 tonnes → market balanced to slight surplus. Silver deficits during solar boom years (2021-2023, photovoltaic demand surged 30%/year), price spiked to $30/oz.

**Step 156-165: Recycling and Secondary Supply**
Silver recycling: 15% of supply (4,000 tonnes/year). Sources: (1) Industrial scrap (electronic scrap, photographic waste, spent catalysts, solar panel EOL - solar panels 25-year life, growing volume). (2) Jewelry scrap. (3) Coin melt (when silver price >> face value, pre-1965 US coins 90% silver melt). Recovery methods: electronic scrap incineration → sweeps (ash containing precious metals) → smelting → electrolytic refining. Photographic fixer solution: silver thiosulfate complex Ag(S₂O₃)₂³⁻ → metallic replacement (steel wool Fe + Ag⁺ → Ag + Fe²⁺) or electrolysis. Jewelry scrap: inquartation (alloy with copper to 25-35% Ag), dissolve copper and silver in nitric acid (silver dissolves as AgNO₃, gold remains), precipitate silver chloride with NaCl (AgCl ↓), reduce to silver metal. Refining yield: 98-99.5% recovery. Economics: recycled silver production cost $8-12/oz vs mined $10-18/oz (competitive, especially from high-grade scrap like MLCC sweeps, 10-20% Ag).

**Step 166-175: Silver in Electronics - Specific Applications**
**Solder alloys:** SAC305 (Sn96.5Ag3Cu0.5), SAC105 (Sn98.5Ag1Cu0.5) - silver hardens solder, improves thermal fatigue resistance, raises melting point (217-220°C vs SnPb eutectic 183°C). Typical solder joint: 0.001-0.01g, 1-3% Ag → 0.00001-0.0003g Ag per joint. Smartphone: 500-1,000 joints → 0.005-0.3g Ag from solder. **Silver flake in die attach adhesives:** conductive epoxy filled with 70-85% silver flakes. Flake size 1-10 µm, aspect ratio 10:1 to 100:1. Provides electrical + thermal conductivity (3-5 W/m·K thermal, 10⁴-10⁶ S/m electrical). Die attach uses 0.1-1mg adhesive → 0.07-0.85mg Ag per die. Power semiconductors, LEDs. **Conductive traces:** thick-film pastes (screen-printed, fire at 850°C), thin-film (sputtered). **MLCC terminations:** end electrodes of multilayer ceramic capacitors (80-95% silver-palladium). MLCC contains 1-10 µm silver, 0.001-0.01mg Ag per capacitor. Smartphone: 800-1,200 MLCCs → 1-5g Ag total. **Membrane switches:** printed silver ink on polyester, 5-20 µm thick traces. Used in keyboards, appliances.

Price: $0.15/kg ($150/tonne, normalized for supply chain model). Actual silver: $600-900/kg ($600,000-900,000/tonne at $20-30/oz). Per solder ball: SAC305 has 3% Ag, ball weighs 0.002g → 0.00006g Ag × $700/kg = $0.00004 per ball. The $0.15 represents simplified input cost in supply chain abstraction, not commodity silver spot price. Allocation to chip: smartphones use 0.5-1.5g silver total (solder, MLCC, sensors) → $0.35-1.05 per phone at $700/kg silver. Main chip package: 0.1-0.3g silver → $0.07-0.21 per package.
