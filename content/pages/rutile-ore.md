1. Rutile (TiO2) occurs in heavy mineral sands
2. Ancient beach deposits containing 1-5% heavy minerals
3. Floating dredge excavates unconsolidated sand
4. Dredge pumps 3,000 tons per hour slurry
5. Wet screening separates >1mm oversize
6. Spiral concentrators for gravity separation
7. Heavy minerals (SG >2.9) concentrate in inner spirals
8. Rutile specific gravity: 4.2
9. Primary concentrate contains 40-60% heavy minerals
10. Magnetic separation removes ilmenite (magnetic)
11. High-intensity magnets (15,000 gauss)
12. Rutile non-magnetic, separated from ilmenite
13. Electrostatic separation uses conductivity differences
14. Conductive minerals (ilmenite, magnetite) removed
15. Non-conductive rutile and zircon separated
16. Gravity tables provide final upgrade
17. Rutile concentrate: 94-96% TiO2
18. Zircon separated as co-product
19. Dry screening classifies by size
20. Optical sorting removes impurities
21. Packaged in 1-ton bulk bags
22. Quality control for TiO2, Fe2O3, Cr2O3
23. Chromium content critical (<0.1% for chloride process)
24. Tailings (95% of feed) returned to pit
25. Progressive rehabilitation behind dredge
26. Topsoil replaced, contoured to original
27. Native vegetation planted immediately
28. Water management in closed circuit
29. Wildlife corridors maintained through lease
30. Production rate: 200,000 tons rutile per year
31. Mine advances 1-2 km per year
32. Full rehabilitation achieved within 2 years
33. Monitoring of rehabilitated land for 5 years
34. Workforce: 150-200 personnel
35. Highly automated dredge operation
