# How to Make Iron Ore

Foundation of steel industry - iron oxide minerals extracted from Earth. Hematite (Fe₂O₃, 70% Fe), magnetite (Fe₃O₄, 72% Fe), taconite (low-grade 25-30% Fe, needs concentration). Global production: 2.5 billion tonnes/year crude ore, 1.3 billion tonnes marketable ore. Steel production: 2 billion tonnes/year consumes 3 billion tonnes iron ore + scrap.

**Step 1-15: Geology and Deposit Types**
Iron: 4th most abundant element in crust (5%), concentrated in banded iron formations (BIF, Precambrian sedimentary, 2.5-1.8 billion years old). **Ore minerals:** Hematite Fe₂O₃ (70% Fe, red/grey, non-magnetic, most common shipped ore). Magnetite Fe₃O₄ (72% Fe, black, strongly magnetic, direct-shipping-ore DSO or needs upgrading). Goethite FeO(OH) (63% Fe, yellow-brown, limonite weathering). Siderite FeCO₃ (48% Fe, carbonate, roasting needed). **Grades:** High-grade DSO (direct shipping ore): >60% Fe, <7% SiO₂, <0.1% P, <0.05% S, minimal processing. Medium-grade: 50-60% Fe, crushing-screening only. Low-grade taconite: 25-40% Fe, requires concentration (grinding, magnetic separation). **Major deposits:** Carajás Brazil (Vale, 18 Gt reserves, 66-67% Fe hematite). Pilbara Australia (Rio Tinto, BHP, FMG, 50+ Gt, 55-63% Fe hematite). Labrador Canada (IOC, magnetite taconite). Kiruna Sweden (LKAB, magnetite, underground). Sishen South Africa (Kumba Iron Ore).

**Step 16-40: Open Pit Mining Operations**
Largest mines: 100-400 million tonnes/year ore production (Carajás N4-N5, Mt Whalerback Pilbara). Strip overburden: draglines (100+ m³ buckets), shovels (50-70 m³), trucks (400 tonne Caterpillar 797F, Komatsu 980E). Stripping ratio: 0.3-2:1 (waste:ore, low for high-grade deposits). Drill blast: rotary drills (310-380mm holes), ANFO explosives (0.3-0.6 kg/tonne rock). Blast 100,000-1,000,000 tonnes per shot (massive scale). Load: electric rope shovels (100 m³ buckets, 700-1,500 tonne/hour), hydraulic excavators. Haul: 400-tonne trucks, 2-10 km to crusher or stockpile, 20-40 km/h loaded, cycle 30-60 min. Autonomous trucks: Rio Tinto 400+ autonomous trucks (SafeAI, Cat Command, no operators, GPS + LiDAR + radar, remote control center Perth 1,500 km away, 15% productivity improvement). Pit depth: 200-700m (deepest: Kiruna underground transition at 1,365m total depth below surface).

**Step 41-65: Crushing and Screening - High Grade**
DSO (62-67% Fe): minimal processing, maximize tonnage, minimize fines. Primary crusher: gyratory (1.5-2m opening, 2,000-10,000 tph) or jaw (1,200mm, 500-2,000 tph), 1,000mm → 200mm. Conveyor: overland belt 2-15 km (pit to plant), 2.4m wide, 2,000-20,000 tph, regenerative braking downhill (generates electricity). Secondary crusher: cone crusher, 200mm → 50mm. Screening: vibrating screens, separate size fractions (lump 8-32mm, fines -8mm, discard ultrafines -0.15mm slimes if possible, reduce shipping cost). Product: lump ore (premium, sinter-ready for blast furnace, $10-30/tonne premium over fines). Sinter fines (6-0.15mm, sinter plant feedstock). Pellet fines (<0.15mm, pellet plant or lower value). Throughput: 10,000-60,000 tph crushing plant (100-500 Mtpa mine).

**Step 66-90: Magnetic Separation - Magnetite/Taconite**
Low-grade magnetite ore (30-40% Fe): grind and concentrate. Grind: SAG mill + ball mill, 80% passing 50-150 µm (liberation size). Magnetic separation: drum separators (permanent magnets or electromagnets 0.5-2 Tesla), magnetite attracted, gangue (silica, alumina) rejected. Multiple stages: rougher → cleaner → scavenger, 3-4 stages typical. Concentrate: 65-70% Fe, 3-8% SiO₂, recovery 85-95% of Fe. Water consumption: 0.5-1.5 m³/tonne ore (wet grinding, magnetic separation). Tailings: fine silica slurry (sand, -50 µm), pump to tailings dam (filtered dry stacking preferred, reduces water, safer). Pelletizing: concentrate too fine for blast furnace, agglomerate into pellets (10-16mm spheres). Mix concentrate + bentonite binder (0.5-1%), roll in disc pelletizer (6-9m diameter, 15° angle, 6-12 rpm), green pellets → induration furnace (1,200-1,350°C, hematite forms hard shell), cooled. Pellets: 65-67% Fe, 3-6% SiO₂, blast furnace premium feedstock ($80-120/tonne).

**Step 91-110: Beneficiation - Gravity and Flotation**
Hematite fines (-0.15mm): upgrade by flotation or gravity. Gravity: spirals (slurry flows down helical channel, centrifugal force separates by density, hematite 5.3 g/cm³ vs quartz 2.65 g/cm³), shaking tables, Falcon/Knelson centrifugal concentrators. Flotation: reverse cationic flotation (float silica, depress hematite). Reagents: amine collectors (dodecylamine 200-800 g/tonne) float quartz at pH 10-11 (caustic), starch (200-1,000 g/tonne) depresses hematite. Froth (silica tailings) overflows, hematite concentrate (60-68% Fe) sinks. Recovery: 75-90% Fe. Applications: upgrade 58% Fe sinter fines to 65% Fe concentrate (higher value, lower impurities for steelmaking).

**Step 111-130: Quality Specifications**
**Blast furnace lump ore:** 62-67% Fe, <5% SiO₂, <2.5% Al₂O₃, <0.08% P, <0.03% S, <8% LOI (loss on ignition, moisture + volatiles), size 8-32mm, tumble index >6.5 (mechanical strength). **Sinter fines:** 60-64% Fe, <7% SiO₂, size 0.15-6mm. **Pellet feed:** 65-68% Fe, <5% SiO₂, -0.15mm. **Pellets (indurated):** 63-67% Fe, <4% SiO₂, 10-16mm, compression strength >250 kg/pellet. **Impurity limits:** Phosphorus <0.08% (causes brittleness in steel, acid Bessemer steel <0.04%). Sulfur <0.03% (hot shortness, cracking during rolling). Silica, alumina (slag formers, increase flux requirement lime/dolomite, energy to melt). Alkalis Na₂O, K₂O <0.05% (damage blast furnace refractory). Specifications vary by customer: Japanese mills (premium for low-Al lump), Chinese mills (tolerate higher impurities, lower price).

**Step 131-150: Transportation and Logistics**
Rail: mine to port, 200-1,000 km, dedicated heavy-haul (30-40 tonne axle load). Pilbara: 1,500 km rail network, 2.4 km long trains (240 wagons × 120 tonne each = 30,000 tonne train), autonomous (driverless, Rio Tinto AutoHaul). Carajás: 892 km Estrada de Ferro Carajás (EFC railroad), 330-wagon trains, 40,000 tonnes. Port: ore terminals, shiploaders (10,000-16,000 tph), stockpiles (2-20 Mt capacity), reclaimers. Blending: mix ores from multiple pits (target specific Fe%, SiO₂%, customer specs). Seaborne trade: 1.5 billion tonnes/year (55% of production exported). Ships: Capesize (180,000-400,000 DWT, largest Valemax 400,000 DWT), cannot pass Suez (too large), route Brazil→China via Cape of Good Hope (40-45 days). Freight: $10-50/tonne (volatile, 2008 peak $150/tonne, 2016 low $3/tonne). CFR price (cost + freight): $100-200/tonne (62% Fe benchmark, Qingdao port China).

**Step 151-165: Blast Furnace Process (Primary Use)**
Iron ore → pig iron (blast furnace) → steel (BOF or EAF). Blast furnace: 30-40m tall, 10-15m diameter, refractory-lined steel shell, produces 10,000-15,000 tonnes pig iron/day. Charge from top: iron ore (lump, pellets, sinter), coke (carbon, fuel + reducing agent), limestone (flux, forms slag). Hot blast (1,200°C preheated air + O₂ enrichment) injected from bottom through tuyeres. Reactions: C + O₂ → CO₂, CO₂ + C → 2CO (carbon monoxide reducing agent). Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂ (hematite reduction, occurs 400-900°C). Molten iron (1,500°C) collects at hearth bottom, tap every 3-4 hours (500-2,000 tonnes/tap). Slag: CaO-SiO₂-Al₂O₃ melt (1,400-1,600°C), floats on iron, tap separately (cement feedstock or aggregate). Consumption: 1.5-1.7 tonnes iron ore + 0.4-0.6 tonnes coke + 0.2-0.3 tonnes flux → 1 tonne pig iron + 0.3 tonnes slag. Modern: pulverized coal injection (PCI, replace 30-40% of coke, cheaper), oxygen enrichment (23-28% O₂ vs air 21%, increases production 10-15%, reduces coke rate).

**Step 166-180: Environmental and Sustainability**
Tailings: 1-2 billion tonnes/year globally (magnetite concentration, beneficiation). Tailings dams: 500+ facilities worldwide, failures (Brumadinho Brazil 2019, 270 deaths, Vale dam burst, 12 Mt tailings sludge flood). Shift to dry stacking: filter press tailings to 15-20% moisture, stack as dense cake (eliminates dam, reduces water, safer but higher capex $50-200M). Water: mining 0.5-1.5 m³/tonne ore (dust suppression, beneficiation). Recycle 80-95% (closed loops, thickeners). Biodiversity: Pilbara (UNESCO heritage, 600 Mya stromatolites, endemic species), mine expansions destroy sacred sites (Juukan Gorge 2020, Rio Tinto destroyed 46,000-year Aboriginal rock shelters, CEO resigned, cultural heritage laws strengthened). Carbon: iron ore mining 0.02-0.05 tonnes CO₂/tonne ore (diesel trucks, processing). But blast furnace ironmaking 1.8-2.3 tonnes CO₂/tonne steel (coke combustion, 70% of steel industry emissions). Green steel: hydrogen direct reduction (H-DRI, replace coke with green H₂, near-zero CO₂, pilot plants Sweden, Germany, capex 3-5× higher, H₂ cost $2-5/kg vs coke $200-300/tonne, economics challenging until carbon price >$80-150/tonne CO₂).

**Step 181-195: Market, Pricing, and Economics**
Global iron ore: 2.5 Gt crude ore, 1.3 Gt marketable product (2023). Top producers: Australia 900 Mt (37%, Pilbara), Brazil 400 Mt (16%, Carajás, Minas Gerais), China 350 Mt (14%, domestic low-grade), India 270 Mt (11%), Russia 95 Mt, South Africa 80 Mt, Ukraine 70 Mt (disrupted 2022), Canada 55 Mt, USA 46 Mt (all magnetite taconite, no high-grade). Exports: Australia 850 Mt, Brazil 350 Mt (70% of seaborne trade). Imports: China 1,100 Mt (70% of trade, 80% of steel production), Japan 100 Mt, South Korea 70 Mt, Europe 100 Mt. Price: $50-220/tonne (2010-2024, 62% Fe CFR China benchmark). Drivers: China steel demand (50% of global), Brazilian supply (Vale weather, dam closures, strikes), Australia supply (cyclones, labor, rail/port constraints), freight rates, currency (AUD, BRL vs USD). Cost structure: Australia DSO $15-25/tonne cash cost (high-grade, short haul), Brazil $20-30/tonne, taconite $40-60/tonne (grinding, concentration), freight $10-50/tonne → CFR $50-150/tonne typical. Profitability: majors (Vale, Rio, BHP) breakeven $30-40/tonne all-in, smaller high-cost (FMG, Chinese mines) breakeven $60-80/tonne. Cyclical: iron ore, steel demand tied to construction, infrastructure, auto (China slowdown 2023, property crash, iron ore $100-120/tonne vs 2021 peak $230/tonne).

Price: $0.10/kg ($100/tonne) represents typical 62% Fe benchmark price. Actual range $50-220/tonne (highly volatile). Per tonne steel: 1.5-1.7 tonnes iron ore → $75-170 ore cost per tonne pig iron → $100-250 ore cost per tonne finished steel (depending on grade, processing). Iron ore is largest cost component in integrated steel mill (40-60% of pig iron cost), drives steel prices directly.
