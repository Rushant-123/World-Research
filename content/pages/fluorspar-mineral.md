# How to Make Fluorspar Ore (CaF₂)

Calcium fluoride mineral - sole commercial source of fluorine. Used for: hydrofluoric acid (semiconductor etching), aluminum smelting (flux), steel making (flux), fluoropolymers (Teflon), fluorocarbons (refrigerants), uranium enrichment (fluorination). Critical mineral - limited deposits, geopolitical concentration (China 60% of production).

**Step 1-10: Geological Formation and Exploration**
Fluorspar (fluorite, CaF₂) forms in hydrothermal veins. Hot fluorine-rich fluids (from magma cooling) migrate through fractures in limestone or granite. Precipitation occurs when fluids cool or react with carbonate rocks: CaCO₃ + 2HF → CaF₂ + H₂O + CO₂. Deposits types: (1) Vein deposits: tabular bodies along faults/fractures, high grade (30-80% CaF₂), narrow (0.5-5m wide), steep dipping. (2) Stratiform deposits: sedimentary beds, lower grade (10-30% CaF₂), large tonnage, flat-lying. (3) Carbonatite-hosted: associated with rare earth elements (REE), moderate grade (20-40% CaF₂). Exploration: geological mapping (identify favorable host rocks), geochemical surveys (soil/stream sediment sampling for fluorine anomalies), geophysics (gravity surveys - CaF₂ density 3.18 g/cm³ higher than limestone 2.7 g/cm³), core drilling (confirm grade and geometry). Typical ore body: 100,000 to 5,000,000 tonnes at 15-40% CaF₂.

**Step 11-25: [Mine Development](excavation) - Underground**
Most fluorspar mines: underground (surface deposits depleted, ore bodies narrow and deep). Access: decline tunnel (spiral ramp, 12-15% grade, 5m wide, 5m high) driven from surface to ore body (depth 50-800m). Ventilation: fresh air supplied by fans (20-100 m³/s), exhaust through raise. Development: drive drifts (horizontal tunnels) along ore zones every 20-50 meters vertically. Cross-cuts perpendicular to drifts for access. Production: drill-and-blast method. Drill pattern: 40-50mm diameter blastholes, 2-4m deep, spaced 1-1.5m, drilled upward at 60-80° angle (sublevel stoping method). Load with ANFO explosives (ammonium nitrate + fuel oil) or emulsion explosives. Blastholes: 1.5 kg/hole. Fire electrically: millisecond delay detonators sequence blast. Broken ore (muck): mucking with LHD (load-haul-dump vehicle, 3-6 tonne bucket) to ore pass (vertical chute). Ore passes feed to haul truck level. Trucks: 20-40 tonne capacity, diesel-powered, haul to surface or shaft. Production rate: 100-500 tonnes/day (small mine), 1,000-3,000 tonnes/day (large).

**Step 26-42: Ore Handling and Primary [Crushing](ore-crusher)**
Surface ore stockpile: dumped from trucks onto grizzly (coarse screen, 300-500mm openings). Oversize broken with hydraulic breaker or secondary blasting. Undersize feeds jaw crusher. Jaw crusher: two steel plates (fixed jaw and moving jaw), compression breaks rock. Feed size: 1,000mm, product size: 150-200mm. Throughput: 50-500 tonnes/hour depending on model. Crushing ratio: 5:1 to 8:1. Adjust closed side setting (CSS) to control product size. Conveyor belt: transports crushed ore to secondary crushing or grinding. Belt width: 600-1,200mm, speed: 2-4 m/s. Ore storage: covered shed or outdoor stockpile (if dry climate).

**Step 43-58: Grinding and Sizing**
Secondary crushing: cone crusher or impact crusher. Reduces 150mm to 25-50mm. Product to rod mill or ball mill. Rod mill: horizontal cylinder, 3-5m diameter, 4-7m long, rotates at 15-20 rpm. Contains steel rods (50-100mm diameter, 3-5m long). Ore + water form slurry (60-70% solids by weight). Rods tumble, grind by attrition and impact. Product size: 1-5mm. Ball mill (alternative or secondary grinding): similar to rod mill but uses steel balls (25-100mm diameter). Grinds finer: 0.1-1mm (100-1000 µm). Classifier: hydrocyclone separates particles by size. Underflow (coarse) returns to mill. Overflow (fine, target -200 mesh = <75 µm) proceeds to flotation. Grinding critical: liberation (free CaF₂ grains from gangue minerals) requires grind to 70-90% passing 200 mesh.

**Step 59-78: Froth [Flotation](mineral-processing) Concentration**
Flotation exploits surface chemistry differences. CaF₂ made hydrophobic (water-repellent), gangue hydrophilic (water-attracting). Flotation reagents: (1) Collector: oleic acid or tall oil fatty acids (C18 unsaturated carboxylic acids, 0.5-2 kg/tonne ore). Adsorbs on CaF₂ surface, makes hydrophobic. (2) Frother: MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol), pine oil (0.05-0.2 kg/tonne). Stabilizes air bubbles. (3) Depressants: sodium silicate (water glass, 1-3 kg/tonne) depresses silicate minerals (quartz, feldspar), prevents floating. Soda ash (Na₂CO₃) pH modifier, pH 8-10 optimal. Flotation cell: mechanical cell (Denver, Outotec), 3-30 m³ volume. Impeller agitates slurry, injects air (creates fine bubbles 0.5-2mm diameter). CaF₂ particles attach to bubbles, float to surface as froth. Skim froth with paddles or launder. Gangue (calcite, quartz, barite, sulfides) sinks as tailings. Flotation bank: 4-10 cells in series (rougher, scavenger, cleaner stages). Recovery: 80-95% of CaF₂ in ore. Concentrate grade: 60-97% CaF₂ depending on application.

**Step 79-92: Product Grades and Specifications**
**Acid-grade fluorspar (acidspar):** >97% CaF₂, <1.5% SiO₂, <0.12% S. For HF production (purity critical - silica contaminates HF). Price: $300-500/tonne. **Metallurgical-grade (metspar):** 60-85% CaF₂. For steel/aluminum flux (lower purity acceptable, larger market). Price: $200-350/tonne. **Ceramic-grade:** 85-95% CaF₂, low iron (<0.1% Fe). For glass, ceramics, enamels. Price: $250-400/tonne. Penalty elements: SiO₂ (consumes HF during acid production: SiO₂ + 4HF → SiF₄ + 2H₂O, reduces yield), sulfur (forms H₂S, contaminant), carbonates (release CO₂, dilutes HF). Separate grades by additional flotation stages (cleaner flotation), magnetic separation (remove magnetite), or gravity separation (jig, shaking table).

**Step 93-105: Dewatering and Drying**
Flotation concentrate: 20-30% solids slurry. Thicken in settling tanks: 10-30m diameter, 3-5m deep, slurry feeds center, clear water overflows edge, concentrate settles to bottom (underflow 50-65% solids). Thickener residence time: 4-12 hours. Flocculants: polyacrylamide (0.01-0.05 kg/tonne) aids settling. Filter: vacuum disc filter, pressure filter, or filter press. Vacuum disc filter: 3-5m diameter rotating disc, partial vacuum pulls water through filter cloth, cake forms on surface (scraped off). Filtrate: 8-12% moisture. Dry in rotary dryer: inclined rotating cylinder (2-4m diameter, 10-20m long), hot air (400-600°C) flows countercurrent to solids. Dryer fuel: natural gas, coal, or oil. Product moisture: <0.5% (critical for storage stability, prevents caking). Cool to <50°C before bagging.

**Step 106-118: Beneficiation for Acid-Grade**
Acid-grade requires >97% CaF₂. Typical flotation concentrate: 85-93% CaF₂. Additional purification: (1) Re-flotation: clean concentrate at higher reagent dosage, reject middlings. (2) Leaching: dissolve carbonate impurities with dilute HCl (calcite: CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂). Wash, filter, dry. (3) Sorting: optical sorting (color-based), X-ray transmission sorting (density-based). Purple fluorite (high CaF₂) separated from white/grey (high calcite). Hand-picking for very high-value lump ore. Final product: lumps (20-80mm, for HF reactors) or fines (<5mm, for steel flux).

**Step 119-130: Global Reserves and Production**
Global reserves: 310 million tonnes CaF₂ content (USGS 2024). Major reserves: Mexico (68M tonnes), China (42M), South Africa (41M), Mongolia (22M), Vietnam (15M). Production 2023: 9 million tonnes (mine production). China: 5.5M tonnes (60% of world, Zhejiang province dominant). Mexico: 1.2M tonnes. Mongolia: 0.9M tonnes. South Africa: 0.2M tonnes. USA: no domestic mine production since 1995 (imported 100% of consumption). US consumption: 0.5M tonnes/year (HF production 0.25M, steel/aluminum 0.15M, other 0.1M). China export restrictions: quota system, 3M tonnes/year export limit (promotes domestic value-added processing to HF, aluminum fluoride). Price volatility: 2011 peak $600/tonne (supply constraints), 2015 low $200/tonne (oversupply), 2020-2024 $300-450/tonne.

**Step 131-140: Environmental and Regulatory**
Tailings: flotation tailings (85-95% of ore mass) contain calcite, quartz, barite. Slurry disposed in tailings pond (impoundment behind dam). Seepage control: lined ponds or seepage collection systems (prevent groundwater contamination). Fluoride in tailings: CaF₂ low solubility (16 mg/L at pH 7), but dissolved fluoride from process water regulated (drinking water standard: <1.5 mg/L fluoride). Treatment: lime precipitation (Ca(OH)₂ + 2F⁻ → CaF₂ + 2OH⁻). Dust control: water sprays on haul roads, conveyors enclosed, dry product in sealed bags. Fluoride dust inhalation: fluorosis (skeletal/dental damage). Workplace exposure limit: 2.5 mg/m³ (as F). Mine reclamation: backfill stopes with tailings (reduces surface disposal), re-vegetate tailings surface (cap with soil, native plants). Closure cost: $5-50M (site-specific).

**Step 141-150: Alternative Sources and Synthetic Fluorite**
Primary production (mining) supplies 85% of global fluorspar. Secondary sources: (1) By-product fluorspar from phosphoric acid production. Phosphate rock (fluorapatite, Ca₅(PO₄)₃F) treated with H₂SO₄ → phosphoric acid + CaSO₄ + SiF₄. Silicon tetrafluoride scrubbed with water → H₂SiF₆ (fluorosilicic acid). React with CaCl₂ → CaF₂ + SiO₂ + HCl. Low-grade synthetic fluorspar (70-80% CaF₂). (2) Recycling: spent HF from petroleum alkylation (neutralize with lime → CaF₂). Limited volume (0.3M tonnes/year globally from secondary sources). Synthetic alternatives: research into fluorine extraction from fluosilicate waste, or seawater (fluoride 1.3 ppm in seawater, but extraction cost-prohibitive). Deposit depletion concern: high-grade acidspar reserves limited (50-100 years at current consumption), lower grades require more energy-intensive beneficiation.

Price: $0.50/kg ($500/tonne) represents acid-grade fluorspar, the premium product. Metallurgical grade: $0.25/kg. Used primarily for HF acid production in semiconductor industry. Per chip allocation: negligible (milligrams of CaF₂-derived HF per chip, amortized cost <$0.01 per chip). This $0.5 represents commodity ore price, not per-chip allocation. Global market: $3-5 billion/year (6-10M tonnes × $300-500/tonne).
