Fossil fuel - liquid petroleum from underground reservoirs. Mixture of hydrocarbons (C₅-C₄₀+, alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics) formed from ancient marine organisms (algae, plankton) buried 2-4 km depth, 50-150°C, 10-200 million years. Uses: transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, jet, 60%), petrochemicals (plastics, fertilizers, 15%), heating oil/residual fuel (10%), asphalt (5%), lubricants (2%), other 8%. Global production: 95 million barrels/day (Mb/d, 2023, 1 barrel bbl = 159 liters = 42 US gallons, 4.9 Gt/year). OPEC 40%, USA 18%, Russia 12%, others 30%.

**Step 1-20: Petroleum System and Geology**
Four requirements: (1) **Source rock** (organic-rich shale, 1-20% TOC total organic carbon, marine algae/plankton deposited anoxic seafloor, kerogen Type II marine, Type I lacustrine best oil-prone, Type III terrestrial gas-prone). Examples: Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay North Sea (140 Mya, 5-15% TOC), Cretaceous Eagle Ford Texas (90 Mya), Permian Wolfcamp Permian Basin (270 Mya), Jurassic-Cretaceous Arabian Gulf source rocks. Burial to "oil window" 2-4 km (60-120°C, geothermal gradient 25-30°C/km), kerogen thermally cracks: kerogen → bitumen → oil + gas (10-150 million years, peak oil generation 90-110°C, deeper/hotter generates gas). (2) **Migration** (oil expels from source, buoyant lighter than water 0.8-0.95 g/mL vs 1.0-1.2 g/mL formation brine, migrates upward through permeable carrier beds sandstone/limestone fractures, 1-100 km lateral/vertical over millions of years). (3) **Reservoir rock** (porous permeable rock, sandstone 15-30% porosity, limestone/dolomite 5-20%, permeability 1-10,000 millidarcies mD, oil accumulates, Ghawar Saudi Arabia Jurassic Arab-D limestone reservoir largest field 80-100 Gb original oil in place). (4) **Trap + seal** (structural anticline/fault, stratigraphic pinch-out, salt dome, cap rock impermeable shale/evaporite prevents upward escape, trap retains oil 1-200 million years until drilled). **Crude types:** Light sweet (API >35°, sulfur <0.5%, WTI West Texas Intermediate benchmark 39-40° API, Brent North Sea 38-39° API, easy refining, high gasoline yield). Medium (30-35° API, Arab Light Saudi 33° API). Heavy (20-30° API, Maya Mexico 22° API, difficult refining, requires coking/upgrading). Extra-heavy (<20° API, Venezuela Orinoco Belt 8-12° API, Cold Lake Canada oil sands bitumen 8-10° API, solid/semi-solid at surface, thermal methods SAGD steam-assisted gravity drainage). Sour crude (>0.5% sulfur, up to 5-7% Middle East, corrosive, H₂S toxic, requires hydrotreating desulfurization).

**Step 21-45: Conventional [Drilling](directional-drilling) and Well Completion**
**Exploration:** Seismic surveys (sound waves reflect off rock layers, 3D/4D seismic maps subsurface structure, identify anticlines, faults, salt domes). Wildcat well (exploratory, 10-30% success rate, $5-50M onshore, $50-300M offshore). **Drilling rig:** Rotary drilling (drill bit rotates, cuts rock, mud circulation removes cuttings, cools bit, maintains pressure). Onshore: land rig 500-2,000 HP drawworks, drill 2-6 km depth (vertical wells conventional, or horizontal shale wells 2-4 km vertical + 1-3 km lateral). Offshore: jackup rig (shallow water <150m, legs extend to seafloor), semi-submersible (deepwater 500-3,000m, floats, anchored or dynamic positioning), drillship (ultra-deep >2,000m, Petrobras pre-salt Brazil 5-7 km water depth + 5 km subsurface record). **Drill bit:** Tricone roller cone (three rotating cones with teeth, 8-17.5" diameter typical, 200-500 rpm, 10,000-40,000 lbf weight on bit), PDC polycrystalline diamond compact (fixed cutter, faster ROP rate of penetration 10-50 m/hour vs tricone 5-20 m/hour). **Casing program:** Surface casing (0.3-1 km, 13-20" diameter, cement to surface, protect freshwater aquifers). Intermediate casing (1-3 km, 9-13", isolate weak formations, overpressure zones). Production casing (total depth, 5-7", through reservoir). Cement: pump slurry down casing, up annulus, sets 12-48 hours (prevent fluid migration between zones, structural support). **Perforating:** Shaped charges (explosives, 1-10 shots per foot, 0.3-0.5" diameter holes penetrate casing + cement + 1-3 ft into formation, allow oil flow into wellbore). Completion: install production tubing (2.5-4.5", run inside casing, packer isolates annulus, wellhead + christmas tree valves control flow at surface).

**Step 46-70: Primary Production and Reservoir Pressure**
**Natural drive mechanisms:** (1) Solution gas drive (dissolved gas in oil expands as pressure drops, drives oil to wellbore, recovery factor RF 5-20%, rapid pressure decline, short plateau, USA onshore typical). (2) Water drive (aquifer below/adjacent reservoir, water expands + influxes, maintains pressure, displaces oil, RF 20-60%, slow decline, Middle East reservoirs). (3) Gas cap drive (free gas above oil, expands downward, RF 15-40%). (4) Gravity drainage (oil drains downward to horizontal wells, heavy oil reservoirs, RF 10-30%). (5) Combination (most reservoirs mixed drive). **Production profile:** Initial production (IP, first 24-hour rate, 50-5,000 bbl/day per well, Ghawar Saudi wells 3,000-10,000 bpd historically, Permian shale 500-2,000 bpd IP, decline 50-80% first year). Decline curve: exponential (shale wells 70-80%/year decline first year, 20-30% year 2-5, 5-10% after year 5, 30-year life produce 300,000-800,000 bbl cumulative EUR estimated ultimate recovery). Conventional exponential-hyperbolic-harmonic decline (10-30%/year initial, flatten to 5-10% after 5-10 years, 20-40 year life, 1-20 million bbl EUR depending on reservoir size). **Field development:** Appraisal wells (delineate extent, 5-20 wells, establish reserves). Development drilling (200-2,000 wells large field, Ghawar 3,000+ wells, Permian Midland Basin 50,000+ horizontal wells 2010-2023). Well spacing: conventional 40-160 acre (250-1,000m spacing, vertical wells), shale 4-20 wells per section (1 square mile = 640 acres, horizontal laterals 1-3 km, stacked pays in multiple benches, Wolfcamp A/B/C/D, Bone Spring, Delaware). Pattern: line drive (producers + injectors for waterflooding), 5-spot/7-spot/9-spot injection patterns.

**Step 71-95: [Artificial Lift](submersible-pump) Systems**
75% of wells require artificial lift (reservoir pressure insufficient, flowing bottomhole pressure <bubblepoint, liquid loading in gas wells). **Rod pump (sucker rod):** Surface unit (beam pump, horsehead 5-25 HP electric motor, 5-20 strokes/min), sucker rods (steel strings connect surface to subsurface pump 500-2,500m depth), downhole pump (plunger reciprocates, check valves intake/discharge). Production: 5-500 bpd (low-rate stripper wells, conventional onshore USA 400,000 wells, 0.5 Mb/d total, mature fields). Limitations: depth <2,500m (rod stretch, weight), high-gas wells (gas lock), deviated >30° (rod friction, wear). **Electric submersible pump (ESP):** Downhole centrifugal pump (50-500 stages, 100-5,000 bpd, 500-3,000m depth), electric motor (100-1,000 HP, 3-phase AC power cable from surface), gas separator (prevents gas lock, rotary separator or reverse-flow). Applications: high-rate wells (offshore, Middle East, shale wells after 1-2 years decline, replace rod pump), high-fluid (water cut 50-98%, waterflooded reservoirs). Costs: $50,000-500,000 per ESP system (depending on depth, HP, instrumentation), run life 1-5 years (wear, sand erosion, electrical failures, workover to replace). **Gas lift:** Inject high-pressure gas down annulus (2-10 MMscf/d gas, 500-3,000 psi), gas lift valves at intervals 300-1,000m depth, gas enters tubing, lightens fluid column (reduce density from 0.9-1.0 g/mL oil to 0.3-0.6 g/mL gas-liquid mixture), reservoir pressure sufficient to lift. Production: 500-10,000 bpd (offshore platforms, deepwater, simple reliable, but requires gas source + compression). **Progressive cavity pump (PCP):** Helical rotor inside stator (1-10 HP, 10-300 bpd, <1,500m depth), handles sand/solids better than ESP, heavy oil (Cold Lake Canada, Venezuela, viscosity 1,000-100,000 cP vs conventional 1-10 cP).

**Step 96-118: [Gathering and Separation](oil-gas-separator)**
Wellhead to central processing facility. **[Flowlines](pipeline-network):** Single-well lines (2-4" diameter, buried or surface, 100-5,000m to manifold/satellite). Multi-well gathering (6-12" trunk lines, 2-20 km to central battery or gas-oil separation plant GOSP). Pressure: 100-1,500 psi (reservoir pressure minus friction losses, boosted by pumps if needed). **Three-phase separation:** Gas-oil-water mixture enters [horizontal/vertical separator](oil-gas-separator) (3-20 ft diameter, 10-60 ft length, residence time 1-5 min). Gravity separates (gas 0.0007-0.002 g/mL density rises, oil 0.8-0.95 g/mL middle, water 1.0-1.2 g/mL sinks). Gas outlet (top, demister removes liquid droplets, 98-99.9% dry gas to compressor or flare if no market). Oil outlet (middle, weir or interface level control, 0.5-5% water + sediment BS&W basic sediment and water, to stock tanks or further treating). Water outlet (bottom, produced water, 50-99% of total fluid in mature fields, 1-10 bbl water per bbl oil typical Saudi, 50-100 bbl/bbl USA waterflooded, to disposal injection or treatment). **Heater treater:** Heat crude 50-150°F (10-65°C) to 120-180°F (50-80°C) in fired heater or heat exchanger (reduce viscosity, break emulsions, coalesce water droplets, enhance gravity separation). Demulsifier chemicals (surfactants 10-100 ppm, break water-in-oil emulsions stabilized by asphaltenes, paraffins, solids). Dehydration to pipeline spec: <0.5-1.0% BS&W, <10 lb salt/1000 bbl (salt NaCl in brine corrodes refinery equipment, desalter at refinery removes, but limit at production). **Free water knockout (FWKO):** Large separator (remove bulk free water before heater treater, reduce heating load, 3-10 min residence, 80-95% of water separates). Skim tanks: API separators (American Petroleum Institute design, laminar flow, oil droplets >150 µm rise to surface skim, 10-60 min detention, remove oil from produced water, <50 ppm oil in water discharge limit offshore, <10-29 ppm some jurisdictions onshore).

**Step 119-140: [Crude Storage](crude-storage) and Custody Transfer**
**Storage tanks:** Atmospheric fixed-roof (cone roof, bolted or welded steel, 100-500,000 bbl capacity, 10-100m diameter, 10-20m height, breathing vents VOC emissions 0.1-1% of throughput, vapor recovery unit VRU captures, returns to process). Floating-roof (internal or external floating roof, seals against tank wall, reduces evaporation 90-95% vs fixed-roof, large terminals 500,000-1,000,000 bbl tanks Cushing Oklahoma 70 million bbl total capacity WTI delivery point). Crude settling: 1-7 days residence (water + sand settle to bottom, sample top/middle/bottom verify quality before pipeline shipment). **Measurement:** LACT unit (lease automatic custody transfer, automated metering, sampler, BS&W monitor, temperature, API gravity, totalizer records volume). Prover loop: calibrate meters (positive displacement meter or turbine meter, ±0.15% accuracy, critical for revenue, million-bbl/month movements $0.15% error = $500,000-5,000,000 annually at $50-100/bbl). **Quality specifications:** API gravity (American Petroleum Institute scale, °API = 141.5/(SG₆₀°F) - 131.5, where SG specific gravity relative to water, light crude 35-45° API, heavy 10-20° API, measured hydrometer or densitometer). Sulfur content (0.1-5%, X-ray fluorescence analyzer, sour >0.5%, pipeline/refinery specs limit <1-2% typically). Vapor pressure (Reid vapor pressure RVP, 3-15 psi at 100°F, controls in refinery, pipelines limit <10-12 psi safety). Sediment + water (<0.5-1%). Salt (<10-50 pounds per thousand barrels PTB). Viscosity (1-10,000 cSt centistokes at 20-40°C, affects pumpability, heavy crude requires heating or diluent blending). Metals (vanadium, nickel, <100 ppm each, catalyst poison in refining). **Blending:** Mix crudes to meet pipeline/refinery specs (lighten heavy crude with condensate or light sweet, diluted bitumen "dilbit" Canada 25-30% diluent, synthetic crude oil SCO if upgraded in coker).

**Step 141-160: Unconventional - Shale Oil (Tight Oil)**
Light tight oil (LTO, USA Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, 40-50° API ultra-light, 0.1-0.3% sulfur, highest gasoline/diesel yield). **Hydraulic fracturing:** Drill horizontal well 2-3 km vertical + 1-3 km lateral through shale (Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, Eagle Ford source rock = reservoir, organic-rich 2-6% TOC, nano-darcy permeability 0.0001-0.001 mD vs conventional 1-1,000 mD). Isolate stage: plug + perf (set bridge plug, perforate casing 5-10 clusters per stage, 20-50 stages per well, 100-300 ft spacing), or sliding sleeves (open ports sequentially). Pump fracturing fluid: 98.5% water + 1.5% proppant (sand or ceramic, 2,000-15,000 tonnes per well, 40/70 mesh) + 0.05% chemicals (friction reducer slickwater polyacrylamide, biocide, scale inhibitor, surfactant). Pressure 8,000-12,000 psi at wellhead, 9,000-14,000 psi bottomhole, fracture gradient 0.7-0.9 psi/ft (exceeds minimum horizontal stress, rock fails in tension, fractures propagate 100-300m into formation perpendicular to wellbore, propped open 2-5mm width). Flowback: 10-40% of injected water returns first 30 days (high TDS 50,000-250,000 ppm, dispose via injection wells Class II or recycle for next frac). Production: IP 500-2,000 bpd oil + 1-5 MMcf/d gas, decline 50-80% year 1 (tight matrix, fracture conductivity loss from proppant embedment, clay swelling, only fractures + near-fracture rock produces). EUR: 300,000-800,000 bbl per well (economics at $50-100/bbl oil, breakeven $35-55/bbl depending on location). **Shale boom:** USA production 5 Mb/d (2010) → 13 Mb/d (2019 peak) → 11 Mb/d (2020 pandemic) → 12.9 Mb/d (2023), Permian Basin 6 Mb/d largest play globally.

**Step 161-175: Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)**
Improve recovery beyond primary 5-20% and secondary waterflooding 20-40%, target RF 40-60%+ (additional 10-30%). **Waterflooding (secondary, not technically EOR but enables tertiary):** Inject water (produced water or seawater offshore, aquifer/river water onshore, treat to <5 ppm oil, <50 ppm TSS solids, biocide prevent souring H₂S, scale inhibitor) into injector wells, sweep oil toward producers. Injection pressure: fracture gradient minus safety margin (0.6-0.9 psi/ft, avoid fracturing cap rock). Pattern: 5-spot (1 injector center, 4 producers corners), line drive (row injectors, row producers), water cut rises 0% → 50% → 90-98% over 10-30 years (economic limit when lifting costs exceed oil revenue). **CO₂ flooding (tertiary EOR):** Inject supercritical CO₂ (31°C, 73 bar above critical point, density 0.2-0.9 g/mL depending on pressure, miscible with oil at 1,200-3,000 psi, swells oil, reduces viscosity, extracts light components). Sources: natural CO₂ deposits (McElmo Dome Colorado, Jackson Dome Mississippi, pipeline 500-800 km to West Texas Permian Basin), industrial capture (ammonia plants, ethanol fermentation, 95-99% CO₂). Inject 0.3-0.6 hydrocarbon pore volumes HCPV (water-alternating-gas WAG, slug CO₂ + slug water, 1:1 to 3:1 ratio, improve sweep efficiency). Production: incremental 5-15% OOIP (original oil in place), extend field life 20-40 years. Cost: CO₂ $15-50/tonne (purchase + transport), $40-90/bbl incremental oil (economic at >$60/bbl oil price). Recycle 50-90% of produced CO₂ (separate from oil/gas, recompress, reinject, net consumption 0.2-0.5 tonnes CO₂ per bbl oil). **Thermal EOR (heavy oil):** Steam injection (cyclic steam stimulation CSS, inject 1,000-10,000 bbl/day steam 300-350°C, soak 1-4 weeks, produce heated oil viscosity 10,000 cP → 10 cP, repeat cycles), or SAGD steam-assisted gravity drainage (horizontal injector 5m above producer, continuous steam, oil drains by gravity, 3-10 bbl water per bbl oil steam-to-oil ratio SOR, 0.5-1.0 GJ natural gas per bbl oil energy intensity). Canada oil sands 1.8 Mb/d (60% mined + upgraded, 40% SAGD in-situ). **Chemical EOR:** Polymer flooding (polyacrylamide 500-2,000 ppm, increase water viscosity, improve sweep, 5-10% incremental RF, China Daqing 300,000 bpd polymer flood largest). Surfactant-polymer (ultra-low interfacial tension, mobilize residual oil, 10-20% incremental, expensive $15-30/bbl chemicals, limited applications).

**Step 176-185: Environmental, Safety, and Lifecycle Emissions**
**Upstream emissions:** Drilling/completion: 0.5-2 tonnes CO₂e per well (diesel rigs 1-3 MW, 2-4 weeks drilling time, flaring flowback gas if no capture). Production: 3-15 kg CO₂e per bbl oil (fugitive methane from valves/compressors, flaring associated gas if no market, venting, electricity for artificial lift, GWP methane 28× CO₂ over 100 years, 84× over 20 years). Processing: 2-8 kg CO₂e/bbl (separators, heater treaters, stabilization, natural gas consumed). **Methane emissions:** 2-10% of produced gas lost historically (pneumatic controllers, tank vents, leaks, flaring, venting). Regulations tightening: USA EPA OOOOb/c rules (2024, leak detection + repair LDAR, flaring restrictions, zero routine flaring goal World Bank 2030). Monitoring: satellites (MethaneSAT, Carbon Mapper detect large emitters >100 kg/hour), aerial surveys, ground-based. Mitigation: vapor recovery units (capture tank emissions, 90-98% reduction), replace high-bleed pneumatics with low-bleed or electric, flare capture (gas-to-liquids GTL, micro-LNG, electricity generation). **Water:** Produced water 1-100 bbl water per bbl oil (mature waterflood 10-100:1, disposal via Class II injection wells 2-4 km depth saline aquifers, or treat + reuse frac/EOR, discharge to surface <1% USA, common offshore if meet <29 ppm oil content). Hydraulic fracturing: 2-6 million gallons water per well (15,000-45,000 bbl, 10-30% flowback, high TDS 50,000-250,000 ppm, recycle or dispose, Oklahoma/Texas injection-induced seismicity concern, magnitude 3-5 earthquakes, regulations limit injection rates/pressures). **Spills:** Pipeline leaks (0.01-0.1% of throughput annually, corrosion, third-party damage, 3-10 spills per 10,000 miles per year, volume 1-10,000 bbl per incident). Offshore blowouts (Deepwater Horizon 2010, Macondo well, 4.9 million bbl, $65B BP liability, regulations tightened blowout preventer BOP reliability, cementing practices, relief well drilling plans). **Lifecycle emissions:** Well-to-tank (upstream + midstream): 8-30 kg CO₂e per bbl (conventional low 8-15 kg, shale 10-20 kg, oil sands 20-30 kg, offshore 10-18 kg). Tank-to-wheels (combustion): 430 kg CO₂ per bbl (305 kg C in oil, 1 kg C combusts to 3.67 kg CO₂, vary by product gasoline/diesel/jet). Total: 440-460 kg CO₂e per bbl consumed (upstream 2-7%, refining 5-8%, transport 1-3%, combustion 85-90%). Per liter gasoline: 2.3 kg CO₂ tailpipe + 0.3 kg upstream = 2.6 kg CO₂e (electric vehicle 0.1-0.5 kg CO₂e per kWh electricity depending on grid, 0.15-0.20 kWh/km = 0.015-0.10 kg CO₂e/km vs gasoline 0.18-0.25 kg/km).

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Transition**
Global oil supply: 95 Mb/d (2023). OPEC 38 Mb/d (40%, Saudi 10, Iraq 4.5, UAE 4, Iran 3, others 16.5 Mb/d), USA 17 Mb/d (18%, shale 9, Gulf of Mexico 2, conventional 6), Russia 11 Mb/d (12%, sanctions post-2022 target 1-2 Mb/d reduction, India/China buyers), Canada 5.5 Mb/d (6%, 3.5 oil sands), China 4 Mb/d (4%, declining mature fields), others 19.5 Mb/d (20%, Brazil 3.8, Norway 1.8, Mexico 2, Angola, Kazakhstan, others). **Demand:** 100 Mb/d consumption (OECD 45 Mb/d declining 0-1%/year, non-OECD 55 Mb/d growing 1-3%/year). Transport 60 Mb/d (gasoline 26, diesel 20, jet 8, marine 6 Mb/d), petrochemicals 15 Mb/d, other 25 Mb/d. **Pricing:** Brent crude $50-120/bbl (2020-2024, pandemic low $20/bbl April 2020, rebound $70-90/bbl 2021-2023, spike $120/bbl March 2022 Ukraine invasion). WTI (West Texas Intermediate) typically $2-5/bbl discount to Brent (landlocked Cushing Oklahoma vs seaborne Brent). OPEC+ manage supply (12 Mb/d spare capacity, Saudi 3-4 Mb/d, UAE 1 Mb/d, swing producers target $70-90/bbl Brent for budget stability). **Reserves:** 1.7 trillion barrels proven (50 years at current rates, but reserve additions offset production, unconventional resources oil sands 1.7 Tb, shale oil 0.5 Tb, offshore deepwater 0.3 Tb extend decades, but climate policy may strand assets). **Peak oil demand:** IEA projects 2025-2030 peak (electric vehicles, efficiency, policy Net Zero 2050 scenario oil demand declines to 25 Mb/d by 2050, Stated Policies scenario plateaus 100-105 Mb/d 2030-2050). OPEC forecasts continued growth to 110-115 Mb/d 2040 (petrochemicals, aviation, developing Asia Africa demand). **Stranded assets:** Risk $1-4 trillion oil/gas infrastructure (high-cost Arctic, deepwater, oil sands uneconomic if carbon price $50-150/tonne CO₂, demand contraction, major companies Shell, BP, TotalEnergies diversifying renewables, but supermajors 90%+ capex still oil/gas 2020-2024).

Price: $0.60/kg crude oil represents $85/bbl Brent crude (1 bbl = 159 L, density 0.85 g/mL = 135 kg/bbl, $85/135 kg = $0.63/kg). Range $20-140/bbl ($0.15-1.05/kg) depending on market (2020 pandemic low $20/bbl, 2022 war spike $120/bbl, typical $60-100/bbl). Used in: refining to fuels (gasoline 44%, diesel/heating oil 32%, jet fuel 8%, residual fuel 4%, LPG 4%) + petrochemicals (naphtha → ethylene/propylene → plastics, aromatics → benzene/toluene/xylene, 8%). Per liter gasoline: 1.05 liters crude → 0.44 liters gasoline (42% yield) → $0.27-0.63/L crude cost at $60-140/bbl (refining adds $0.10-0.30/L, tax adds $0.30-1.50/L depending on country, retail $1-2.5/L). Per kg plastic (polyethylene): 1.8 kg crude → 1 kg ethylene → 1 kg PE, $1.08-1.90 crude cost at $60-140/bbl oil.
