# How to Make Epoxy Resin

Thermosetting polymer - crosslinks upon curing to form strong, chemically resistant solid. Uses: chip packaging (molding compound), printed circuit boards (FR-4 laminate), package substrates, adhesives, coatings, composites. Global production: ~3 million tonnes/year. Most common: DGEBA (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A).

**Step 1-12: [Bisphenol A](bpa-chemical) (BPA) Production**
BPA synthesis: phenol + acetone → bisphenol A. Reaction: 2 C₆H₅OH (phenol) + (CH₃)₂CO (acetone) → (CH₃)₂C(C₆H₄OH)₂ (BPA) + H₂O. Acid catalyst: HCl or ion exchange resin (Amberlyst-15). Reactor: stirred tank, 50-70°C, 2-4 hours. Molar ratio: phenol:acetone = 2.5:1 to 4:1 (excess phenol). Conversion: 90-95% acetone per pass. Unreacted phenol: recovered by distillation, recycled. Product: crude BPA, crystallize from molten state or from toluene solution. Purity: 99.7-99.9% BPA. Melting point: 156°C. BPA production: 5 million tonnes/year globally (50% for epoxy resins, 35% for polycarbonate plastics, 15% other).

**Step 13-28: [Epichlorohydrin](epichlorohydrin) (ECH) Production**
ECH synthesis from propylene (petrochemical). Route 1 (chlorohydrin process): propylene + Cl₂ + H₂O → allyl chloride → 1,3-dichloropropene → epichlorohydrin. Multi-step, generates chlorinated byproducts. Route 2 (modern, direct oxidation): propylene + Cl₂ → allyl chloride. Allyl chloride + Cl₂ + H₂O → dichlorohydrin. Dichlorohydrin + NaOH → epichlorohydrin + NaCl + H₂O. Temperature: 50-80°C. Catalyst: Lewis acids (AlCl₃) or calcium hydroxide. Yield: 85-90%. Purify by distillation: boiling point 116°C. Purity: 99.5% ECH. Hazards: carcinogen (probable), lachrymator (causes tearing), handle in closed systems. Global production: 2 million tonnes/year (80% for epoxy resins, 20% for other chemicals).

**Step 29-45: Epoxy Resin Synthesis - Taffy Process**
React [BPA](bpa-chemical) + [ECH](epichlorohydrin) + [NaOH](caustic-soda). Stoichiometry: BPA:ECH = 1:2 to 1:10 (excess ECH). Two-step reaction: (1) Etherification: BPA hydroxyl groups react with epichlorohydrin (OH + epichlorohydrin → chlorohydrin ether). (2) Dehydrochlorination: chlorohydrin ether + NaOH → epoxy group + NaCl + H₂O (eliminates HCl, forms epoxide ring). [Reactor](glass-lined-reactor): stirred vessel, jacketed for heating/cooling. Charge: BPA (solid, 228 g/mol), molten ECH (liquid, 92.5 g/mol, 10:1 molar excess), dissolve at 50-60°C. Add aqueous NaOH solution (50% w/w) dropwise over 2-4 hours at 60-80°C (exothermic - control temperature). [Phase transfer catalyst](phase-transfer-catalyst): benzyltrimethylammonium chloride (BTMAC, 0.1-0.5% by weight) - enhances reaction rate (transfers hydroxide ions into organic phase). Reaction time: 3-5 hours. Product: DGEBA (liquid resin, epoxide equivalent weight EEW = 180-190 g/eq for liquid grades).

**Step 46-62: Workup and Purification**
Reaction mixture: epoxy resin + excess ECH + salt (NaCl) + water + byproducts. Phase separation: organic phase (resin + ECH) separates from aqueous phase (salt water). Decant aqueous phase. Wash organic phase with water (3-5 washes, removes residual salt, NaOH). Distillation: recover excess ECH under vacuum (ECH bp 116°C at 1 atm, distill at 40-60°C under 100-200 mbar). Recovered ECH: 90-95% (recycle to reactor). Residue: crude epoxy resin. Further purification: add toluene or xylene (diluent, reduces viscosity), filter through activated carbon or bleaching clay (removes color, particulates), filter through 10 µm cartridge. Vacuum strip solvent and light ends (traces of ECH, water) at 120-150°C, 5-10 mbar, 2-4 hours. Final product: clear to pale yellow liquid, viscosity 10,000-15,000 cP at 25°C, EEW 185-192 g/eq, hydrolyzable chlorine <0.8% (residual chlorine from ECH).

**Step 63-78: Higher Molecular Weight Resins (Solid Epoxies)**
Liquid DGEBA: average n=0.15 (mostly n=0, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, with small amounts of n=1 oligomers). Solid resins: higher molecular weight, n=2 to 10, semi-solid to solid at room temperature. Synthesis: advancement reaction. React liquid DGEBA with additional BPA (no ECH). Ratio: excess epoxy groups over OH groups. Temperature: 140-180°C. Catalyst: triphenylphosphine (TPP, 0.05-0.2%). Reaction: epoxy end group reacts with BPA hydroxyl, forms ether linkage, chain extends. OH + epoxide → -O-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂- (opens epoxide ring). Polymerization degree controlled by stoichiometry: slight excess epoxy → longer chains. Typical products: EEW 450-3,500 g/eq, softening point 70-150°C (higher MW = higher softening point). Solidify by cooling, flake on chilled rolls or cast into blocks. Grind to powder (particle size 50-500 µm) for easy handling.

**Step 79-93: Specialty Epoxy Resins**
**Novolac epoxy:** phenol-formaldehyde novolac reacted with ECH. Multifunctional (>2 epoxy groups per molecule), high crosslink density when cured → superior heat resistance (Tg 180-220°C vs DGEBA 130-180°C). Used in semiconductor molding compound, high-temp composites. **Cycloaliphatic epoxy:** alicyclic structure (cyclohexene oxide). UV-curable, low viscosity, excellent weatherability. Used in coatings, adhesives. **Brominated epoxy:** BPA replaced with tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). Flame retardant (49-58% bromine content). Used in PCBs (FR-4 with bromine for UL94 V-0 rating). **Flexible epoxy:** long-chain diols (polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol) replacing BPA. Low modulus, high elongation. Used in adhesives, sealants. **Bio-based epoxy:** derived from plant oils (epoxidized soybean oil, lignin-based BPA substitutes). Lower performance but renewable, lower carbon footprint. Emerging market.

**Step 94-108: Quality Control and Specifications**
Epoxide Equivalent Weight (EEW): grams of resin containing one mole of epoxy groups. Measured by titration: react epoxy with HCl in acetone (opens epoxide ring), back-titrate with NaOH, calculate from consumption. Typical liquid DGEBA: EEW 185-192 g/eq. Viscosity: measured by Brookfield viscometer at 25°C. Liquid resins: 10,000-15,000 cP. Diluted resins (with reactive diluent): 500-3,000 cP. Hydrolyzable chloride: residual ECH or chlorohydrin. Measured by Volhard titration (reflux with alcoholic KOH, titrate liberated Cl⁻ with AgNO₃). Spec: <0.8% for electronics grade. Epoxy content by GPC (gel permeation chromatography): molecular weight distribution. Liquid resin: Mn 340-380 g/mol, polydispersity 1.1-1.3 (narrow distribution). Color: Gardner scale (1-18, lower is lighter). Spec: <1 for clear grades, <3 for standard. Purity: total impurities <0.5% (BPA, ECH, high-MW oligomers, salts).

**Step 109-122: Curing Agents and Crosslinking**
Epoxy resin alone is unreactive (stable for months at room temperature). Requires curing agent (hardener) to crosslink. Curing agents: (1) Amines: aliphatic (DETA, TETA - fast cure, room temp), cycloaliphatic (isophorone diamine - slower), aromatic (DDS, MDA - high temp cure, superior heat resistance). Stoichiometry: amine H equivalents = epoxy equivalents. (2) Anhydrides: phthalic anhydride, MHHPA (methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride). Cure at 120-180°C, 2-8 hours. Long pot life, low viscosity, good electrical properties. Used in casting, laminates. (3) Phenolic resins: novolac or resole. Cure 150-200°C. High crosslink density. Semiconductor molding compound uses phenolic curing. (4) Catalytic: imidazoles, tertiary amines. Accelerate epoxy-epoxy homopolymerization. Cure: exothermic reaction, epoxide rings open, form ether and hydroxyl groups, build 3D network. Gel time: minutes to hours (depends on formulation, temperature). Full cure: 70-95% conversion of epoxy groups (measure residual epoxy by FTIR).

**Step 123-135: Cured Properties and Applications**
Cured DGEBA-amine system: glass transition temperature (Tg) 130-180°C, tensile strength 70-90 MPa, flexural modulus 2.5-3.5 GPa, elongation 3-6%, low shrinkage (1-5% cure shrinkage vs 10-20% for polyesters). Excellent chemical resistance (acids, bases, solvents - crosslinked network insoluble). Electrical properties: dielectric constant 3.5-4.5 at 1 MHz, dielectric strength 15-25 kV/mm, volume resistivity 10¹⁴-10¹⁶ Ω·cm. Adhesion: polar hydroxyl groups bond to metals, glass, ceramics. Applications: **Composites:** carbon fiber + epoxy (aerospace structures, wind turbine blades, sporting goods). Prepreg: fabric pre-impregnated with partially cured epoxy, laid up, cured in autoclave. **Coatings:** protective coatings (pipes, rebar, marine), powder coatings (appliances, automotive). **Adhesives:** structural adhesives (automotive, construction, electronics assembly). **Laminates:** FR-4 (woven fiberglass + brominated epoxy, PCB substrate). **Molding compound:** epoxy + silica filler + hardener (encapsulate semiconductors). **Flooring:** seamless epoxy floors (industrial, commercial). Market: packaging and composites each ~25%, coatings 20%, electrical/electronics 15%, adhesives 10%, other 5%.

**Step 136-145: Environmental and Health**
BPA concerns: endocrine disruptor (mimics estrogen), developmental effects. Controversy over low-dose effects. Regulations: banned in baby bottles (EU, USA, Canada), restricted in food contact (some jurisdictions). Epoxy industry response: develop BPA-free resins (bisphenol F, bisphenol S, aliphatic epoxies - lower performance, higher cost). ECH hazards: carcinogenic (Group 2A, probable human carcinogen IARC), reproductive toxin. Manufacturing facilities: closed systems, vapor recovery, exposure limits (PEL 5 ppm TWA). Cured epoxy: inert, low toxicity (BPA and ECH fully reacted, not leachable). Uncured: skin sensitizer (allergic contact dermatitis). Handle with gloves, avoid skin contact. Dispose uncured resin as hazardous waste. Cured resin: inert solid, landfill acceptable (but not biodegradable). Recycling difficult (thermoset - cannot melt and remold). Emerging: chemical recycling (solvolysis, depolymerization to recover monomers - research stage).

**Step 146-150: Market and Economics**
Global epoxy resin market: $10-12 billion/year, 3-3.5 million tonnes (2023). Growth: 5-7%/year (driven by wind energy, electronics, automotive lightweighting). Price: $2-4/kg for standard liquid DGEBA, $3-8/kg for specialty grades (novolac, high-purity electronics grade). Regional production: China 45%, Europe 25%, North America 15%, Asia ex-China 15%. Major producers: Hexion (USA), Olin (USA), Huntsman (Switzerland), Kukdo (Korea), NanYa Plastics (Taiwan), Sinopec (China). Raw materials: BPA $1.5-2.5/kg, ECH $1.2-2.0/kg → epoxy resin $2-4/kg (raw materials ~80% of cost, conversion adds 20-30%). Value chain: propylene → ECH → epoxy resin → formulated product (composite, adhesive, molding compound) → end use (aircraft, wind turbine, iPhone). Barriers to entry: capital cost ($50-200M for 50,000 tonne/year plant), technology licensing (patents on catalysts, processes), customer qualification (aerospace, automotive require 2-5 years testing/approval).

Price: $0.40/kg represents bulk liquid DGEBA resin, standard grade. High-purity semiconductor grade: $0.60-1.00/kg. Solid resins: $0.50-0.80/kg. Used extensively in chip packaging (molding compound 15-20% epoxy), package substrates (copper-clad laminate 30-40% epoxy), PCBs (FR-4 is 30-40% epoxy resin by weight). Per chip allocation: milligrams to grams of epoxy depending on package type. In supply chain model, $0.4 represents input cost of epoxy resin feedstock entering downstream processing.
