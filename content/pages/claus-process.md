1. Thermal reactor refractory-lined
2. Combustion chamber operates at 1,000-1,400°C
3. One-third of H2S burned with air
4. Reaction: H2S + 1.5O2 → SO2 + H2O
5. Stoichiometric ratio H2S:SO2 = 2:1 maintained
6. Waste heat boiler recovers heat
7. Steam generated at 40-60 bar
8. Gas cooled to 200-350°C for catalytic stage
9. First catalytic converter
10. Alumina catalyst (activated Al2O3)
11. Catalyst bed depth: 0.5-1.5 meters
12. Claus reaction: 2H2S + SO2 → 3S + 2H2O
13. Equilibrium conversion ~70% at 250°C
14. Sulfur condenser cools gas to 155°C
15. Molten sulfur separates and drains
16. Second catalytic converter
17. Reheater brings gas to 220-250°C
18. Additional conversion to sulfur
19. Second sulfur condenser
20. Third catalytic stage (optional)
21. Overall sulfur recovery: 95-97% (3 stages)
22. Tail gas treatment for >99% recovery
23. Hydrogenation converts all sulfur species to H2S
24. Amine absorption captures remaining H2S
25. Concentrated H2S returned to Claus plant
26. Tail gas incinerator before stack discharge
27. SO2 emissions <250 ppm
28. Catalyst life: 3-5 years
29. Catalyst poisoning by hydrocarbons or ammonia
30. Sulfur product purity: 99.5-99.9%
31. Degassing removes dissolved H2S
32. Filtration removes catalyst fines
33. Liquid sulfur storage at 130-145°C
34. Trace heat maintains liquidity
35. Solidification system for transport
36. Process control automation
37. Oxygen analyzer controls air-to-acid-gas ratio
38. Temperature control via bypasses
39. Safety: H2S and SO2 monitoring
