- [MP Materials](/companies/mp-materials)



Group of 17 metals - lanthanides (15 elements, La through Lu) + scandium + yttrium. Critical for high-tech: permanent magnets (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb for motors, generators, hard drives), phosphors (Eu, Tb, Y for displays, LEDs), catalysts (La, Ce for petroleum refining), batteries (La in NiMH), glass polishing (Ce). Global production: 280,000 tonnes REO (rare earth oxides, 2023). China dominance: 70% mining, 90% processing (separation, refining).

**Step 1-20: Geology and [Ore Types](bastnasite-mining)**
Rare earths not actually "rare" - more abundant than gold, platinum (Ce as common as copper 68 ppm in crust, Tm least abundant 0.5 ppm, still 200× gold). Challenge: disperse, seldom concentrated, difficult to separate (chemical similarity). **Ore minerals:** Bastnäsite (Ce,La,Y)CO₃F (70% of production, light REE-rich, Mountain Pass CA, Bayan Obo China). Monazite (Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO₄ (phosphate, heavy REE, contains thorium 4-12% radioactive, regulatory challenges, beach sands Australia/India). Xenotime YPO₄ (heavy REE, yttrium-rich). Ion-adsorption clays (South China, weathered granite, REE adsorbed on clay minerals, 0.05-0.2% REO but easy to extract, HREE-rich Dy, Tb, Y). **Classification:** Light REE (LREE): La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu (atomic numbers 57-63). Heavy REE (HREE): Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu (64-71) + Y (39), + Sc (21). HREE scarcer, more valuable (Tb $1,200/kg, Dy $350/kg vs La $3/kg, Ce $4/kg). **Deposits:** Bayan Obo, China (1.5 billion tonnes ore, 6% REO, world's largest, iron-REE deposit). Mountain Pass, USA (1.4 million tonnes REO reserves, 8% grade, only US mine). Mount Weld, Australia (Lynas, 1.5 million tonnes REO). Nechalacho, Canada (heavy REE project). Ionic clays: southern China (Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong provinces, 1-2 million tonnes REO reserves, 70% of global HREE supply).

**Step 21-45: Mining and Beneficiation - Hard Rock (Bastnäsite)**
Open pit mining: drill-blast-haul (similar to copper/iron). [Crush](ore-crusher): jaw crusher 1,000mm → 150mm, cone crusher 150mm → 10mm. Grind: ball mill or SAG mill to 70-90% passing 75 µm (liberation size for bastnäsite grains 50-200 µm). **Flotation:** Bastnäsite floats with fatty acid collectors (oleic acid, hydroxamic acids 0.5-2 kg/tonne ore) at pH 8-10 (sodium carbonate). Depressants: sodium silicate (1-3 kg/tonne) depresses silicates, fluorite. Rougher flotation → cleaner flotation → regrinding → scavenger. [Flotation concentrate](mineral-processing): 50-70% REO, 10-15% CaO, 5-10% Fe₂O₃, remainder SiO₂, fluorides. Recovery: 70-85% of REE in ore. **Gravity concentration:** Bastnäsite density 4.9 g/cm³, use shaking tables, spirals, centrifugal concentrators to pre-concentrate before flotation. **Magnetic separation:** Separate monazite (weakly magnetic, paramagnetic, Fe³⁺ in structure) from xenotime and gangue. Wet high-intensity magnetic separator (WHIMS).

**Step 46-70: Ion-Adsorption Clay Processing (China Southern)**
REE adsorbed electrostatically on clay minerals (kaolinite, halloysite), not in mineral lattice (unlike bastnäsite). Easy extraction: no crushing, grinding, or flotation. **In-situ leaching:** Drill injection wells into clay layer (depth 2-20m), inject ammonium sulfate (NH₄)₂SO₄ solution (2-5% concentration). Ammonium ions (NH₄⁺) displace adsorbed REE³⁺ by ion exchange: Clay-REE³⁺ + 3NH₄⁺ → Clay-3NH₄⁺ + REE³⁺. Pregnant solution (REE-bearing) collects in drainage channels at hillside base (gravity flow). Concentration: 200-1,000 ppm REO. Inject 2-5 m³ solution per tonne ore, extract 60-90% of REE. **Precipitation:** Add oxalic acid (C₂H₂O₄) or ammonium bicarbonate (NH₄HCO₃) to pregnant solution. REE oxalates precipitate: 2REE³⁺ + 3C₂O₄²⁻ → REE₂(C₂O₄)₃ ↓. Filter, wash, dry. **Roasting:** Heat oxalates to 800-900°C in air (oxidize to oxides). REE₂(C₂O₄)₃ + heat + O₂ → REE₂O₃ + 6CO₂. Mixed rare earth oxide (MREO): 88-92% REO, HREE-rich (30-50% Y₂O₃, 5-15% Dy₂O₃, 1-5% Tb₄O₇, remainder Gd, Er, Ho, Lu, Tm). **Environmental issues:** Ammonium sulfate leaching (acidifies soil pH 3-5, leaches aluminum, mobilizes heavy metals, groundwater contamination). Unregulated mining: 60-80% of Chinese ionic clay mines illegal 2000s-2010s (deforestation, landslides, ammonia pollution in rivers). Crackdown 2011+: consolidation, licensing, but enforcement uneven. Radioactivity: monazite processing generates thorium-rich tailings (232Th half-life 14 billion years, decay chain to radon Rn-220, alpha emitter). Regulatory: <0.1 Bq/g thorium in products (China), <5 Bq/g (international). Waste disposal: lined tailings ponds, neutralize with lime, cover with soil.

**Step 71-95: [Acid Cracking](chemical-extraction) of Concentrate**
Bastnäsite concentrate (60% REO) → dissolve REE into solution for separation. **Sulfuric acid roasting:** Mix concentrate with concentrated H₂SO₄ (1:1 to 1:2 mass ratio), heat to 200-500°C in rotary kiln or fluidized bed (2-6 hours). Reactions: REE-bastnäsite + H₂SO₄ → REE₂(SO₄)₃ + HF + CO₂ (REE converts to water-soluble sulfates). Fluorine evolves as HF (corrosive, scrub with water → H₂SiF₆ byproduct for sale or neutralize). **Water leaching:** Dissolve roasted calcine in water (80-100°C, 1-3 hours stirring). REE sulfates dissolve (10-50 g/L REO in solution), insoluble oxides/silicates (Fe, Al, Si, Th) remain as residue. Filter: separate leach liquor from residue. Residue disposal: neutralize with lime (pH 7-8), tailings pond. **Caustic cracking (alternative):** Mix concentrate with sodium hydroxide NaOH (2-3:1 NaOH:concentrate), roast at 400-700°C. REE-bastnäsite + NaOH → REE(OH)₃ + Na salts. Leach with water, REE hydroxides stay insoluble. Dissolve hydroxides in HCl: REE(OH)₃ + 3HCl → RECl₃ + 3H₂O. Chloride solution: 20-100 g/L REO. Advantage over sulfate: less gypsum waste (CaSO₄ forms when neutralizing sulfate solutions), but higher chemical cost.

**Step 96-125: [Solvent Extraction Separation](separation-plant) (SX) - Most Critical Step**
Mixed rare earth solution contains all 15-17 REE in similar concentrations (distribution depends on ore: bastnäsite 50% Ce, 25% La, 15% Nd, 5% Pr, 5% others; monazite more even distribution; clays HREE-rich). Challenge: lanthanides chemically nearly identical (same +3 oxidation state, similar ionic radii 103 pm La³⁺ to 86 pm Lu³⁺, decrease 1-2 pm per element). Separate by subtle differences in complexation chemistry. **Solvent extraction (liquid-liquid):** Organic extractant selectively binds REE from aqueous solution, extracts into organic phase. Fractional extraction exploits slight preference differences. **Extractants:** (1) Di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA, HDEHP): most common, chelates REE³⁺, selectivity increases with atomic number (prefers HREE > LREE, separation factor α ≈ 2-3 between adjacent lanthanides). (2) Tributyl phosphate (TBP): for chloride or nitrate systems. (3) Primary amine salts (e.g., Primene JMT): for sulfate systems. (4) Naphthenic acid: Ce separation. (5) Cyanex 272, PC88A: enhanced selectivity for middle/heavy REE. **Process:** Cascade of mixer-settlers (100-300 stages for high-purity separation, each stage = mix box + settler box). Aqueous feed enters one end, organic solvent enters opposite end (countercurrent). HREE preferentially extract into organic phase, flow toward organic outlet. LREE stay in aqueous phase, flow toward aqueous outlet. Recycle organic phase (scrub, strip, regenerate). **Example - Nd/Pr separation from La/Ce:** Feed: mixed REO dissolved in HCl (50 g/L REO, pH 3-4). Organic: 0.5 M D2EHPA in kerosene or Isopar. 200 extraction stages: first 50 stages (La, Ce extract least, discharge in aqueous raffinate). Middle 100 stages (gradual concentration profiles, Pr and Nd accumulate). Last 50 stages (scrub with dilute HCl, strip Nd and Pr into aqueous, collect high-purity NdCl₃, PrCl₃ solutions). Repeat for other REE pairs: Nd/Sm, Sm/Eu, Gd/Tb, Tb/Dy, Dy/Ho, etc. **Complexity:** Separating all 15 lanthanides requires multiple SX trains, 500-1,000 total stages. Facility size: 2-10 hectares, 10,000-50,000 mixer-settlers, 500-2,000 m³ organic inventory. Processing time: 50-200 hours (solution residence, recirculation). Efficiency: 95-99.9% purity achievable (99.9-99.999% for critical elements like Dy, Tb if needed for magnets). Waste: spent organics (hydrocarbon diluents, emulsions, degraded extractants), saline aqueous raffinate (NaCl, CaCl₂, residual REE <0.1%, discharge to wastewater treatment or evaporate to dryness).

**Step 126-150: Precipitation and Calcination to Oxides**
After SX, individual REE in chloride, sulfate, or nitrate solution (50-200 g/L REO, 99-99.99% purity single element). **Precipitation methods:** (1) Oxalic acid (most common): RECl₃ + 1.5 H₂C₂O₄ → RE₂(C₂O₄)₃ ↓ + 3HCl. REE oxalates precipitate (sparingly soluble, Ksp 10⁻²⁸ to 10⁻³⁰). Filter, wash (remove chlorides), dry (100-150°C, <1% moisture). (2) Sodium carbonate: 2RECl₃ + 3Na₂CO₃ → RE₂(CO₃)₃ ↓ + 6NaCl. Carbonates less dense, easier filtration. (3) Hydroxides: RECl₃ + 3NaOH → RE(OH)₃ ↓ + 3NaCl. Gelatinous precipitate, difficult washing. (4) Fluorides: RECl₃ + 3HF → REF₃ ↓ + 3HCl. For specific applications (flux, optical materials). **Calcination:** Decompose precipitates to oxides. Oxalates: heat to 800-1,000°C in air, [rotary kiln or muffle furnace](calcination). RE₂(C₂O₄)₃ + 3O₂ → RE₂O₃ + 6CO₂ (exothermic). Carbonates: 600-900°C, RE₂(CO₃)₃ → RE₂O₃ + 3CO₂. Hydroxides: 500-900°C, 2RE(OH)₃ → RE₂O₃ + 3H₂O. **Product:** High-purity individual rare earth oxides (REO). La₂O₃, CeO₂, Pr₆O₁₁, Nd₂O₃, Sm₂O₃, Eu₂O₃, Gd₂O₃, Tb₄O₇, Dy₂O₃, Ho₂O₃, Er₂O₃, Tm₂O₃, Yb₂O₃, Lu₂O₃, Y₂O₃, Sc₂O₃. Appearance: white (La, Gd, Y, Lu), yellow (Ce, Pr, Tb), pink (Er, Nd), green (Pr₆O₁₁), brown (Sm, Eu). Purity: 99-99.99% (3N to 4N) for most, 99.9-99.999% (4N-5N) for critical magnets/phosphors. Impurities: other REE (most common, <0.1-1% depending on grade), Fe, Ca, Si (each <0.01% for high-purity).

**Step 151-170: Metal Reduction (for Metallic REE)**
Applications requiring metal (not oxide): permanent magnets (Nd-Fe-B, Sm-Co), alloys, getters. **Metallothermic reduction:** Reduce REE oxide with calcium or lanthanum metal. Reaction: RE₂O₃ + 3Ca → 2RE + 3CaO (highly exothermic, ΔH -600 to -800 kJ/mol). Process: Mix REE oxide powder with calcium turnings (10-20% excess), load into tantalum or molybdenum crucible (refractory, non-reactive), evacuate (10⁻³ mbar) or argon atmosphere. Heat inductively to 1,300-1,600°C (reaction ignites, self-sustaining). Hold 1-4 hours (ensure complete reduction, coalescence of metal droplets). Cool, remove slag (CaO crust). Product: REE metal ingot, 95-98% purity, 5-10 kg per batch. **Fused salt electrolysis (industrial scale):** Electrolyze molten REE chloride or fluoride. Example - Nd metal: Electrolyte: NdCl₃ (20-40%) + NaCl or KCl (60-80%, lowers melting point to 600-800°C vs NdCl₃ pure 758°C). Cell: graphite crucible (anode), molten pool collects at iron cathode (bottom). DC current: 5-50 kA, 5-15V. Nd³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Nd (plates at cathode). Cl₂ gas evolves at anode (captured, recycled to make NdCl₃). Product: molten neodymium metal, periodic tap to molds. Purity: 99-99.9% Nd. Dysprosium, terbium similarly produced. Cerium: electrolysis of CeO₂ dissolved in molten fluoride. **Purification:** Vacuum distillation (for high-purity Sc, Y, Lu, Yb - volatile REE). Zone refining (pass induction coil along ingot, impurities concentrate in melt zone). Sublimation (Sc, Yb under high vacuum 10⁻⁵ mbar, 1,200-1,500°C).

**Step 171-185: Applications and Critical Elements**
**Permanent magnets (35% of REE value):** Nd-Fe-B (neodymium-iron-boron, strongest magnets 40-52 MGOe, Tesla motors, wind turbines, hard drives, headphones, speakers). Composition: Nd₂Fe₁₄B (70% Fe, 30% Nd+Pr+Dy+B by weight). High-temperature grades: add 2-10% Dy or Tb (increases coercivity, prevents demagnetization at 150-200°C in motors). Sm-Co (samarium-cobalt, 18-32 MGOe, high-temp stable to 300°C, military, aerospace). Consumption: 35,000 tonnes Nd, 5,000 tonnes Pr, 2,000 tonnes Dy, 200 tonnes Tb per year (2023). **Catalysts (20%):** Fluid cracking catalysts (FCC) for oil refining, La and Ce (zeolite support, 2-5% REO). Automotive catalysts: Ce in ceria-zirconia (CeO₂-ZrO₂, oxygen storage, 50-80 g/vehicle). **Phosphors (5%):** LED phosphors: Y₃Al₅O₁₂:Ce (YAG:Ce, yellow, blue LED + YAG = white light). Eu³⁺ (red emitter), Tb³⁺ (green). Fluorescent lamps (declining with LED adoption). **Batteries (10%):** NiMH (nickel-metal hydride, La-Ni alloy anode, hybrid cars, batteries). Declining with Li-ion dominance. **Glass/polishing (10%):** CeO₂ polishing compound (LCD, optics, precision glass, consume 20,000 tonnes/year). La₂O₃ in optical glass (high refractive index, camera lenses, 5-40% La).

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Geopolitics**
Global production: 280,000 tonnes REO (2023, oxide equivalent). China: 210,000 tonnes (75% of mining, 90% of separation/refining, Bayan Obo, Sichuan, Jiangxi clusters). Myanmar: 30,000 tonnes (exports to China, unregulated, conflict zones). USA: 43,000 tonnes (Mountain Pass, MP Materials, concentrate exported to China for separation until 2023, domestic separation ramping). Australia: 25,000 tonnes (Lynas, Mount Weld mine, separation plant Malaysia - environmental controversy, Kalgoorlie plant under construction). **Prices (2023, 99% oxide, $/kg):** La $3, Ce $4, Pr $80, Nd $70, Sm $5, Eu $40, Gd $45, Tb $1,200, Dy $350, Ho $100, Er $45, Yb $20, Lu $800, Y $8, Sc $4,000. Volatility: Nd spiked to $180/kg (2011 China export restrictions), crashed to $40/kg (2016 oversupply), rebounded $100-140/kg (2021-2022 EV boom). **Critical supply:** Dy, Tb (HREE for high-temp magnets, 90% from China clays, limited alternatives). Security concerns: 2010 China-Japan Senkaku dispute (China halted REE exports, Japan scrambled for alternatives, diversification efforts). Geopolitics: US-China tensions, export controls, reshoring efforts (US DOD funding, IRA subsidies). **Alternatives and efficiency:** Reduce Dy content in magnets (grain boundary engineering, 5% Dy → 0.5% Dy maintains coercivity, patented by Hitachi). Dy-free magnets (R&D, heavy-REE-free compositions). Recycling: end-of-life magnets (hard drives, EVs disassemble magnets, reprocess 70-90% recovery, Hitachi, Urban Mining Company). 2023: <1% of REE from recycling, potential 20-30% by 2040.

Price: $20/kg represents weighted-average mixed rare earth compound (not yet separated). Actual prices vary 1,000×: lanthanum $3/kg to scandium $4,000/kg. Individual high-purity separated elements for magnets/phosphors: $40-1,200/kg. In supply chain context, REE used in: permanent magnets (speakers, vibration motors, hard drives in devices), phosphors (display backlights, LEDs), catalysts (petroleum refining for plastics), glass (camera lenses, optics). Per smartphone: ~0.5g Nd (magnets), 0.05g Eu/Tb (phosphors), 0.3g Y (glass) → $0.05-0.15 total REE content at current prices.
