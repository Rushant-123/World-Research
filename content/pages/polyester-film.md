Polyester (PET) film is a biaxially oriented thermoplastic film with exceptional mechanical strength, dimensional stability, chemical resistance, and optical clarity. Widely used as a substrate for flexible printed circuits, capacitor dielectrics, insulating tapes, labels, and packaging, PET film combines tensile strengths exceeding 200 MPa with thermal stability up to 150°C. Manufacturing involves melt extrusion followed by sequential biaxial stretching that aligns polymer chains, creating a film with balanced properties in both directions. Available in thicknesses from 2 to 350 micrometers, PET films can be surface-treated or coated for specific applications including adhesion promotion, release properties, or anti-static performance.
