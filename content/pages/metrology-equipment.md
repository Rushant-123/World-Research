Measure dimensions and properties at nanometer scale. Critical for process control - if measurements drift out of spec, adjust process parameters before yield drops.

**[Ellipsometer](optical-ellipsometry):** Measures thin film thickness and optical properties. Shines polarized light, measures reflection. Accuracy: ±0.1nm for films 1-1000nm thick.

**[Profilometer](surface-profiler):** Measures surface height with stylus or optical interferometry. Maps wafer topography. Resolution: 0.1nm vertical, 1µm lateral.

**[SEM Tool](scanning-electron-microscope):** Scanning Electron Microscope for CD (critical dimension) measurement. Measures feature widths. Resolution: 1nm. Critical for lithography control.

[Metrology Software](metrology-software) analyzes data, calculates statistics, sends feedback to process tools. In-line metrology: every wafer measured. Sampling: 1-10% of wafers. Metrology cost: 5-10% of fab capex. Essential for sub-10nm nodes where specs are ±1nm.
