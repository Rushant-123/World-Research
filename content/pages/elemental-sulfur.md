# How to Make Elemental Sulfur

Bright yellow nonmetal - S₈ ring structure at room temperature. Uses: sulfuric acid production (90% of sulfur demand, 250 Mt H₂SO₄/year consumes 85 Mt S), fertilizers (ammonium sulfate, elemental S soil amendment, 5%), chemicals (carbon disulfide, sulfur dichloride, 2%), vulcanization (rubber tire manufacturing, 1%), other 2%. Global production: 90 million tonnes/year (2023). Sources: recovered sulfur from petroleum/gas desulfurization (90%), Frasch mining (5%, nearly obsolete), volcanic/native deposits (3%), pyrite roasting (2%, declining).

**Step 1-20: Sour [Natural Gas](natural-gas) and Petroleum Feedstocks**
Hydrocarbon reservoirs contain hydrogen sulfide (H₂S, "sour gas," toxic, corrosive, 10-40% concentration in some Middle East, Central Asia, North America sour gas fields) and organic sulfur compounds (mercaptans RSH, thiophenes, disulfides). Petroleum: crude oil 0.1-5% sulfur by weight (light sweet <0.5%, heavy sour 2-5%, Venezuelan, Canadian oil sands, Middle East grades). Must remove before combustion or processing (H₂S + SO₂ emissions cause acid rain, corrode equipment, poison catalysts). **Sulfur content drivers:** Geological source rock (marine sediments high organic S, Jurassic limestone Middle East 2-4% S reservoirs). Thermal maturity (thermogenic gas from deep formations >3 km often contains H₂S from thermochemical sulfate reduction TSR: hydrocarbons + CaSO₄ → H₂S + CaCO₃ + H₂O at 120-180°C over millions of years). Bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR, <80°C, produces H₂S in shallow reservoirs). **Processing imperative:** Pipeline gas spec: <4 ppm H₂S, <70 ppm total sulfur. LNG: <1 ppm H₂S (cryogenic temperatures, corrosion risk). Refinery feeds: desulfurize to <0.001% S (ultra-low-sulfur diesel ULSD <15 ppm S, gasoline <10 ppm S regulations EPA/EU). Byproduct sulfur: large gas processing plants produce 1,000-10,000 tonnes/day elemental sulfur (equivalent to dedicated Frasch mine, but as unavoidable byproduct, economic incentive to recover vs vent or flare).

**Step 21-45: [Amine Gas Sweetening](gas-sweetening) (H₂S Removal)**
Absorb acid gases (H₂S, CO₂) from natural gas or refinery streams using alkanolamines. **Amine selection:** Monoethanolamine (MEA, 15-25% aqueous, aggressive, high capacity, corrosive at high CO₂/H₂S loads). Diethanolamine (DEA, 20-30%, moderate, less corrosive). Methyldiethanolamine (MDMA, 30-50%, selective for H₂S over CO₂, preferred for high CO₂ gas). Proprietary formulations (Flexsorb, Sulfinol, blends with physical solvents). **Absorber tower:** Packed column (10-40 trays or structured packing, 1-5m diameter, 20-50m tall, carbon steel with corrosion inhibitors). Sour gas enters bottom (10-100 bar pressure, 20-50°C), flows upward. Lean amine solution enters top (regenerated, low H₂S/CO₂ loading), flows downward. Countercurrent contact: H₂S + RNH₂ → RNH₃⁺ + HS⁻ (amine protonates, forms ion pair, exothermic absorption ΔH -70 kJ/mol). CO₂ + 2RNH₂ + H₂O → (RNH₃⁺)₂CO₃²⁻ (carbonate formation). Exit: sweet gas (top, <4 ppm H₂S, 1-3% CO₂ residual if MDEA used). Rich amine (bottom, saturated with H₂S, 0.3-0.7 mol acid gas per mol amine). **Amine regeneration:** Heat rich amine to 100-130°C in reboiler (steam-heated, indirect heating via kettle or thermosiphon reboiler). Reverses reactions: RNH₃⁺ + HS⁻ → RNH₂ + H₂S ↑ (H₂S gas liberates, endothermic ΔH +70 kJ/mol). Stripper column (10-20 trays, atmospheric pressure or slight vacuum 0.5-1 bar), H₂S + CO₂ gas exits overhead (acid gas stream, 20-90% H₂S, 10-80% CO₂, balance H₂O vapor). Lean amine exits bottom (hot, 110-120°C), cools via heat exchanger with rich amine (energy integration), pumps back to absorber. Cycle: amine recirculates indefinitely (makeup 0.1-0.5 kg per tonne gas processed, losses to degradation, vaporization, foaming).

**Step 46-72: [Claus Sulfur Recovery](claus-process) Unit**
Convert H₂S to elemental sulfur. Claus process: 2H₂S + 3O₂ → 2SO₂ + 2H₂O (combustion), then 2H₂S + SO₂ → 3S + 2H₂O (Claus reaction, produce sulfur). Invented 1883 Carl Friedrich Claus, refined 1930s-1950s with catalytic stages, modern plants 95-99.5% sulfur recovery (balance H₂S + SO₂ in tail gas, requires further treatment). **Thermal stage (reaction furnace):** Acid gas (from amine stripper, 20-90% H₂S) + combustion air (stoichiometric 1/3 of H₂S combusts to SO₂, 2/3 remains as H₂S, 2:1 H₂S:SO₂ ratio ideal for Claus reaction) injected into refractory-lined furnace at 900-1,400°C. Reactions: H₂S + 3/2O₂ → SO₂ + H₂O (exothermic, provides heat, autothermal if acid gas >40% H₂S). 2H₂S + SO₂ → 3S₂ ↑ + 2H₂O (elemental sulfur vapor forms, S₂ dimers at high temp). Minor: 2H₂S + 3O₂ → 2SO₂ + 2H₂O. If hydrocarbons present (refinery sour gas with C₁-C₄): CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O (combusts, adds heat). Residence time: 0.5-2 seconds. Exit gas: 900-1,200°C, contains SO₂ + H₂S + S₂ vapor + H₂O + CO₂ + N₂. **Waste heat boiler:** Cool gas to 300-350°C, generate high-pressure steam (40-60 bar, 250-300°C, powers plant turbines or exports to facility). Sulfur condenses: S₂ → S₈ (liquid sulfur, 119°C melting point, yellow, viscous). First condenser: cool to 160-180°C (sulfur liquid, 1.8 cP viscosity, separates by gravity, drains to sulfur pit). Gas: SO₂ + H₂S + steam, still out of stoichiometric balance (excess H₂S or SO₂ depending on combustion control, aim 2:1 but typically 1.8-2.2:1 in practice, requires catalytic stages to complete conversion).

**Step 73-98: Catalytic Claus Reactors**
**Catalytic conversion stages:** 2-3 fixed-bed reactors in series, packed with [Claus catalyst](alumina-catalyst) (activated alumina Al₂O₃, 3-6mm spheres, 200-300 m²/g surface area, or titanium dioxide TiO₂). Reaction: 2H₂S + SO₂ ⇌ 3S + 2H₂O (equilibrium-limited, exothermic ΔH -147 kJ per 3 mol S produced, equilibrium shifts to products at lower temperature, but kinetics slow below 220°C, catalyst enables reaction at 200-300°C). **First catalytic stage:** Reheat gas from condenser (160°C) to 220-240°C (fired heater or heat exchanger), pass through reactor bed (residence 2-5 seconds, space velocity 1,000-2,000 h⁻¹). Conversion: 60-70% of remaining H₂S + SO₂ → S. Exit: cool to 160-180°C in condenser, sulfur liquid separates. **Second catalytic stage:** Reheat to 200-220°C, pass through second reactor (similar catalyst). Conversion: 20-30% of remaining. Condense sulfur at 140-160°C. **Third catalytic stage (if present, high-recovery plants):** Reheat to 180-200°C, reactor, condense at 130-140°C (near sulfur freezing point, careful control to prevent solid plugging). Total conversion: 94-97% with 2 stages, 96-99% with 3 stages (diminishing returns, each stage smaller than previous). **Tail gas:** Exit final condenser, contains 0.5-5% residual sulfur compounds (H₂S, SO₂, COS carbonyl sulfide, CS₂ carbon disulfide, S vapor), balance N₂, CO₂, H₂O. Regulations: <250 ppm SO₂ in stack (older plants), <50 ppm (modern BACT), <10 ppm (California, EU IED). Requires tail gas treating.

**Step 99-120: [Tail Gas Treatment](sulfur-polishing) (Ultra-High Recovery)**
Reduce tail gas sulfur to <10-50 ppm total sulfur. **Hydrogenation + amine absorption (SCOT, Shell Claus Off-gas Treating):** Reduce all sulfur species to H₂S: SO₂ + 3H₂ → H₂S + 2H₂O (hydrogenation over CoMo catalyst, 260-320°C). COS + H₂O → H₂S + CO₂ (hydrolysis). CS₂ + 4H₂ → 2H₂S + CH₄. Hydrogen source: natural gas reforming or amine unit off-gas. Cool gas, absorb H₂S in amine (DEA or MDEA), recycle acid gas to Claus unit front end. Tail gas to incinerator (thermal oxidizer 650-1,000°C, H₂S + SO₂ → SO₂, stack <10-50 ppm SO₂). Recovery: 99.5-99.9% total sulfur. **Direct oxidation (Selectox, Sulfreen):** Oxidize H₂S directly to elemental sulfur at low temperature: H₂S + 1/2O₂ → S + H₂O (selective catalyst, 120-150°C, no SO₂ formation). Advantages: simpler, no hydrogen required. Disadvantages: catalyst poisoning by COS/CS₂, narrow operating window. **BSR/CBA (Beavon, Wellman-Lord):** Older technologies, reduce all sulfur to H₂S, absorb in caustic or amine, oxidize to sulfur in liquid phase (bacterial catalysis in BSR, chelated iron in CBA). **Incinerator (minimum treatment):** Combust tail gas: 2H₂S + 3O₂ → 2SO₂ + 2H₂O, SO₂ exits stack. Regulatory compliance only if <250 ppm SO₂ achievable (small plants, low-sulfur gas, or grandfathered facilities, increasingly non-compliant in OECD).

**Step 121-140: Sulfur Solidification and Handling**
Claus unit produces liquid sulfur (135-160°C, bright yellow, viscosity 7-15 cP at 135°C, increases to 100-200 cP at 160°C, then decreases above 160°C as S₈ rings break into chains). **Storage:** Molten sulfur pits (underground concrete-lined vaults, 5,000-50,000 tonnes capacity, steam heating coils maintain 130-150°C, insulated roof, vent scrubbers for H₂S/SO₂). Residence time: 1-30 days (buffer production variations, await shipment). **Forming methods:** (1) **Prilling:** Spray molten sulfur through nozzles at top of tower (30-50m tall), droplets fall through countercurrent cool air (ambient or chilled), solidify as spherical prills 1-6mm diameter, collect at bottom. Prill tower: 10-500 tonnes/day capacity. Product: free-flowing yellow prills (bulk density 0.9-1.1 g/cm³, dust-free, easy handling, ships in bulk carriers, trucks, railcars). (2) **Granulation:** Pour molten sulfur onto rotating drum or belt, cool with water spray, breaks into granules 1-10mm irregular shape (less controlled than prilling, cheaper equipment). (3) **Blocking:** Pour into large moulds (rectangular blocks 100-1,000 kg, or hemispheres 5-20 tonnes "Sulfur balls"), cool slowly (solidifies over 12-72 hours), store in open yards (stable in air, insoluble in water, minimal environmental concern if contained). Break blocks before use (crusher, hammer mill). (4) **Slating:** Pour molten sulfur onto cooled belt or rotating disc, forms thin wafers or flakes (historical method, rarely used, labor-intensive). **Sulfur properties:** Melting point 115-119°C (depends on allotrope, S₈ rhombic 115°C, monoclinic 119°C). Boiling point 445°C. Density: 2.07 g/cm³ (solid), 1.82 g/cm³ (liquid at 120°C). Insoluble in water, soluble in carbon disulfide. Slow oxidation in air (forms thin SO₂ layer if stored >1 year in warm humid climates, but sulfur stable decades in dry conditions). Flammable: ignites 232-260°C (auto-ignition), burns with blue flame to SO₂.

**Step 141-160: Alternative Source - Frasch Mining (Historical)**
Extract sulfur from underground salt dome deposits (Texas, Louisiana Gulf Coast, Sicily, Poland). Frasch process (1890s Herman Frasch): Inject superheated water (160-170°C, 6-10 bar pressure) down outer pipe of 3-concentric-pipe well. Melts sulfur (115°C melting point). Compressed air down innermost pipe lifts molten sulfur + water froth to surface (airlift pump principle). Separate sulfur (liquid, 99.5-99.9% pure), solidify in large blocks or vats (27,000 tonne "sulfur pyramids" iconic at Texas Gulf Sulfur sites, 1960s photos). **Decline:** Frasch production peaked 8-10 Mt/year (1970s, USA 5-6 Mt, Mexico 2-3 Mt, Poland 1 Mt), now <0.5 Mt/year. Reasons: (1) High energy cost (superheated steam, 10-15 GJ per tonne sulfur vs Claus 0.5-1 GJ). (2) Reserves depleting (economic deposits exhausted, remaining too deep >600m or low-grade). (3) Environmental issues (subsidence from caverns, brine disposal, H₂S emissions). (4) Recovered sulfur abundance (petroleum desulfurization growth 1990s-2020s, 70 Mt/year byproduct sulfur vs 15 Mt demand 1970s, Frasch non-competitive, prices crashed from $150-200/tonne 1970s to $30-150/tonne 2000s-2020s). Last major Frasch mine: Big Hill Texas (closed 2000), Tarnobrzeg Poland (closed 1990s).

**Step 161-175: Pyrite Roasting and Volcanic Sulfur (Minor Sources)**
**Pyrite (FeS₂) roasting:** Historic sulfuric acid feedstock (pre-1970s, 50% of global H₂SO₄ from pyrite, now <2%). Roast pyrite ore in air: 4FeS₂ + 11O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ + 8SO₂ (sulfur dioxide gas, feed to Contact process for H₂SO₄). Byproduct: iron oxide ("pyrite cinder," low-grade Fe₂O₃, limited use in cement or sintering). **Decline:** Economics (cheaper to recover sulfur from petroleum than mine and roast pyrite, energy-intensive roasting 2-4 GJ/tonne vs Claus 0.5-1 GJ). Environmental (SO₂ emissions, acid rain, cinder disposal with heavy metals As, Pb, Hg traces). Last major pyrite acid plants: China (1-2 Mt/year remaining, Inner Mongolia, Anhui province, supply-local fertilizer plants, not export-competitive). **Volcanic sulfur:** Native sulfur deposits near active/dormant volcanoes (Sicily, Indonesia Kawah Ijen, Japan, Chile). Mine by open pit or underground, 80-99% pure sulfur (mixed with rock, ash, refine by melting + decanting or Frasch-like steam injection). Production: <0.1 Mt/year (artisanal, Indonesia miners carry 70-90 kg baskets of sulfur down Ijen caldera, $3-5/day wage, extremely hazardous SO₂ fumes, burn injuries, pulmonary damage, romanticized by photographers but exploitative conditions). Used locally (rubber vulcanization, chemicals, cosmetics), not globally significant.

**Step 176-185: Specifications and Quality Grades**
**Crude sulfur (Claus product, default grade):** 99.5-99.95% elemental sulfur (S₈ primarily, minor S₂-S₇ allotropes). Impurities: <0.05% ash (Al₂O₃, SiO₂ catalyst fines, Fe₂O₃), <0.03% carbon (organic residues from acid gas hydrocarbons, soot), <0.01% acidity (H₂SO₄ traces from oxidation, measured as ppm H₂SO₄ equivalent), <500 ppm moisture. Color: bright yellow (pure), tan/brown if carbon contamination. Odor: none if pure (elemental S₈ odorless), slight H₂S if residual (rotten egg, <10 ppm H₂S acceptable for most uses). **Refined sulfur (pharmaceutical/food-grade):** 99.9-99.999% S. Impurities: each <10 ppm (As, Se, Te each <1 ppm, heavy metals <5 ppm total), <0.001% acidity, <0.005% ash. Color: bright lemon yellow. USP/FCC/BP pharmacopeia specs (used in topical medications, acne treatments, fungicides, food additive E220-228 as sulfites/sulfur dioxide preservative). Produced by vacuum distillation (crude sulfur vaporizes at 445°C under vacuum 0.01-0.1 bar, condenses as ultra-pure liquid, impurities remain as residue). **Rubber-grade sulfur:** 99.5-99.9%, low acidity (<0.01%, critical - acid degrades rubber during vulcanization), ash <0.05%, oil-treated (1-3% hydrocarbon oil coating, prevents caking, improves dispersion in rubber compounds). Vulcanization: cross-links polymer chains (styrene-butadiene rubber SBR, natural rubber NR, isoprene IR), 0.5-5% sulfur addition depending on hardness target. Tire manufacturing: 1-2 kg sulfur per passenger tire (80 Mt tires/year, 1.5-2.5 Mt sulfur demand).

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Logistics**
Global sulfur production: 90 Mt/year (2023, elemental basis). Recovered sulfur: 80 Mt (89%, petroleum desulfurization 60 Mt, natural gas 20 Mt). Pyrite/ore: 2 Mt (2%). Frasch/other: 1 Mt (1%). **Geographic production:** Middle East 25 Mt (28%, Saudi Arabia 10 Mt, UAE 4 Mt, Qatar 3 Mt, Iraq 2 Mt, Iran 6 Mt, sour gas giants), North America 15 Mt (17%, USA 10 Mt Gulf Coast refineries + Alberta, Canada 5 Mt oil sands), Russia/FSU 12 Mt (13%, Gazprom Astrakhan, Orenburg sour gas), Asia 20 Mt (22%, China 12 Mt refineries, India 3 Mt, others 5 Mt), EU 8 Mt (9%), other 10 Mt (11%). **Demand:** Sulfuric acid 80 Mt (89%, fertilizers phosphate/sulfate 70%, metal leaching 8%, other chemicals 11%). Elemental use: 4 Mt (rubber vulcanization 2 Mt, agriculture soil amendment 1 Mt, chemicals CS₂/sulfur chlorides 1 Mt). Other: 3 Mt (pharma, food, gunpowder, matches, negligible individually). **Surplus situation:** Production 90 Mt, consumption 87 Mt (2023), surplus 3 Mt (accumulation, stockpiles Middle East deserts, Alberta sulfur blocks 10-20 million tonnes inventory, "yellow pyramids"). Historical: 1990s-2000s demand-supply balanced, 2000s-2020s oversupply (environmental desulfurization mandates, refinery/gas plant expansion faster than sulfuric acid demand growth). **Pricing:** $20-250/tonne FOB (2000-2024 range, extreme volatility). Recent: $50-150/tonne (2020-2024, Vancouver FOB benchmark $80-120/tonne Middle East/North Africa MENA netback $20-80/tonne, freight to market determines). Crash to $10-30/tonne (2014-2016, oil price collapse, oversupply). Spike to $200-250/tonne (2008, China shortage, phosphate fertilizer boom). Cost structure recovered sulfur: $10-40/tonne (energy, chemicals, labor, if allocate zero cost to sulfur as "waste disposal" byproduct vs paying for environmental treatment, breakeven negative to $20/tonne). **Trade:** 15-20 Mt/year seaborne (Tampa, Vancouver, Middle East export ports → China, India, Brazil, Morocco phosphate fertilizer hubs). Bulk carriers (Handysize, Supramax, molten sulfur in heated tanks or solid in holds). Freight: $15-60/tonne (depending on route, bunker fuel prices).

Price: $0.15/kg ($150/tonne) represents higher-end refined or tight-market sulfur price. Actual range $20-250/tonne (highly cyclical, surplus markets $30-80/tonne common, tight supply $120-200/tonne). Used primarily in: sulfuric acid production (90% of sulfur, fertilizers phosphate acidulation, metal leaching copper/nickel/uranium/rare earths, chemicals alkylation), rubber vulcanization (tire manufacturing, 2% of sulfur), direct soil application (agriculture, sulfur-deficient soils, 1%), chemical synthesis (CS₂ carbon disulfide for rayon/cellophane, sulfur chlorides for dyes/pesticides, sodium sulfide in pulp/paper kraft process, <2%). Per tonne sulfuric acid: 0.33 tonnes elemental sulfur → $50-83 sulfur cost component depending on market.
