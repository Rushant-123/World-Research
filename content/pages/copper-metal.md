# How to Make Copper Metal

High-purity copper metal (99.99% Cu) from sulfide ore concentrate via pyrometallurgical smelting and electrolytic refining. Primary use: electrical conductivity (second only to silver, 5.96×10⁷ S/m at 20°C). Applications: electrical wire (50% of demand), electronics/PCBs (20%), construction plumbing/roofing (15%), industrial machinery/heat exchangers (10%), transportation (5%). Global production: 25-27 million tonnes/year refined copper. Chile: 5.6 Mt (28%), Peru: 2.4 Mt (12%), China: 2.0 Mt (10%), USA: 1.3 Mt (6%), DRC: 1.2 Mt (6%).

**Step 1-15: [Copper Ore](copper-ore) Mining - Chalcopyrite Extraction**

Copper ores: chalcopyrite CuFeS₂ (most common, 34.6% Cu theoretical, dominant primary ore), bornite Cu₅FeS₄ (63% Cu, less common), chalcocite Cu₂S (80% Cu, enrichment zones), covellite CuS (66% Cu, secondary). Mined ore grades: 0.3-2.0% Cu (open-pit porphyry deposits 0.3-0.8% Cu, underground vein deposits 1-3% Cu). Major deposits: Atacama Desert Chile (Escondida 1.2 Mt/year, Collahuasi, El Teniente), Arizona/Utah USA (Morenci, Bingham Canyon), Peru (Cerro Verde, Antamina), Indonesia (Grasberg), Zambia/DRC Copperbelt. **Open-pit mining (90% of production):** Porphyry copper deposits (large low-grade disseminated ore bodies, 500-5,000 Mt reserves, 0.3-1.2% Cu). Drill blast pattern: 10-15m diameter holes, 12-15m deep, 150-300kg ANFO explosive per hole, 5×6m blast grid. Blast: fragments rock to 0.1-1.5m diameter. Load: hydraulic shovels (30-120m³ bucket, CAT 7495, Komatsu PC8000) or wheel loaders into haul trucks (220-400 tonne capacity, Caterpillar 797, Komatsu 980E, Liebherr T284). Haul distance: 1-6km to primary crusher, grade 8-12% (minimize fuel, cycle time 25-45 minutes). Waste:ore ratio: 1:1 to 4:1 depending on deposit geometry (strip 1-4 tonnes waste rock per tonne ore).

**Step 16-32: Primary and Secondary Crushing**

Transport ore to crushing plant (adjacent to pit rim or in-pit mobile crushers for ultra-deep pits >500m). **Primary crusher:** Gyratory crusher (inlet 1,500mm, crushing 900-1,500mm boulders to 150-300mm product), capacity 1,000-10,000 tonnes/hour. Grizzly screen (bar spacing 400-600mm) upstream removes fines, prevents crusher jamming. Crusher mechanics: conical head gyrates eccentrically inside concave bowl (mantle), crushing rock in compression. Reduction ratio: 3:1 to 5:1. Power: 400-1,200 kW (drive motor + hydraulic systems). Liner replacement: manganese steel liners wear 0.5-2mm/day, replace every 4-12 months. **Conveyor transport:** Overland conveyors (1,200-2,400mm belt width, 3-8 m/s speed, 2,000-15,000 tonnes/hour) transport crushed ore 0.5-10km to concentrator mill. Belt: steel-cord reinforced rubber, 12-20mm thick. Idler spacing: 1.5-3m. Energy: 0.5-1.5 kWh/tonne-km. **Secondary crushing:** Cone crusher (Symons 7' standard cone, 300mm feed to 50-100mm product) or high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR, two counter-rotating rolls, 30-100 MPa pressure, micro-crack ore, reduce grinding energy 20-40%). Reduction ratio: 3:1 to 6:1. Closed-circuit crushing: vibrating screen (50mm aperture) returns oversize to crusher (circulating load 200-400%).

**Step 33-52: Grinding and Liberation**

Reduce ore to <150 µm (90% passing) to liberate copper minerals from gangue (quartz, feldspar, clays). **SAG mill (semi-autogenous grinding):** Rotating drum 8-12m diameter, 4-6m length, 5,000-15,000 kW motor (largest single motors in mining). Charge: 8-12% steel balls (100-150mm diameter, 35-45 HRC hardness), 70-80% ore + water slurry, 10-18% void space. Rotation: 9-11 rpm (70-80% critical speed), centrifugal force lifts charge, cascades/cataracts, impacts/grinds ore. Autogenous: ore fragments act as grinding media (pebbles 25-75mm). Residence time: 8-15 minutes. Throughput: 300-2,000 tonnes/hour. Liner: rubber or manganese steel lifter bars (300-600mm length, trapezoidal profile), wear 2-8mm/month. **Pebble crusher:** Screen SAG mill discharge (12-50mm pebbles, critical size that doesn't grind efficiently), crush in cone crusher, return to SAG mill. **Ball mill (secondary grinding):** 5-8m diameter, 8-12m length, 3,000-8,000 kW. Charge: 35-40% steel balls (25-75mm graduated sizes), 30-35% slurry. Rotation: 12-14 rpm (75-78% critical speed). Grinding media consumption: 0.5-2 kg steel/tonne ore (wear, oxidation). Product: 80% <150 µm, 50% <75 µm (P₈₀ = 150 µm specification). Hydrocyclones classify discharge: overflow <150 µm to flotation, underflow >150 µm recycles to mill (circulating load 200-350%). Energy: 12-18 kWh/tonne ore (largest energy consumer in concentrator, 40-50% of plant electricity).

**Step 53-75: Froth Flotation - Copper Sulfide Concentration**

Separate hydrophobic copper minerals from hydrophilic gangue using air bubbles. Flotation fundamentals: contact angle >90° (hydrophobic) attaches to bubbles, <90° (hydrophilic) stays in slurry. **Reagent conditioning:** Mix slurry (25-35% solids) with [flotation reagents](flotation-chemicals) in conditioning tanks (5-15 minutes). (1) Collectors: xanthates (sodium ethyl xanthate, sodium isopropyl xanthate, 20-80 g/tonne ore) - dithiophosphates, thionocarbamates for supplementary collection. Xanthate adsorbs on CuFeS₂ surface: ROC(S)S⁻ + Cu⁺ (surface) → ROC(S)S-Cu (hydrophobic coating). (2) Frothers: MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol, 10-30 g/tonne), pine oil, polyglycol ethers - stabilize bubble foam, prevent coalescence. (3) pH modifiers: lime Ca(OH)₂ (0.5-3 kg/tonne, raise pH to 9.5-11.5, depress pyrite FeS₂ flotation). (4) Depressants (if needed): sodium cyanide NaCN (10-50 g/tonne, depress pyrite), sodium sulfite Na₂SO₃ (depress talc, prevent slime coating). **Rougher flotation:** [Flotation cells](flotation-equipment) - mechanically agitated tanks 5-30m³ (Outotec TankCell, Metso RCS, FLSmidth WEMCO) or column cells (12-20m tall, 1-4m diameter, bubble generators). Air injection: impeller disperses air (1-3 m³/min per m³ cell volume), bubbles 0.5-2mm diameter. Slurry residence: 8-20 minutes (4-10 cells in series, total 50-200m³ bank). Copper minerals attach to bubbles, rise to surface (froth layer 10-30cm deep), overflow launder skims froth. Recovery: 85-92% Cu minerals, grade 8-20% Cu (concentrate 1). Tailings (waste) to next stage or discard (reject 85-95% of mass, 8-15% Cu lost).

**Step 76-95: Cleaner Flotation and Regrinding**

Upgrade rougher concentrate grade, reject remaining gangue. **Cleaner flotation:** Re-float rougher concentrate (lower reagent doses, 5-15 g/tonne collector, selective separation). Cleaner cells: 2-4 stages, each stage produces concentrate (higher grade) + tailings (scavenge or return to rougher feed). Final concentrate: 20-35% Cu, 25-32% S (chalcopyrite concentrate CuFeS₂ is 34.6% Cu, 34.9% S theoretical - close approach indicates high purity). **Regrinding (if needed):** Middling products (partial liberation) regrind in IsaMill or Stirred Media Detritor (SMD) - horizontal stirred mills with 2-6mm ceramic or steel beads, high energy intensity (30-100 kWh/tonne), grind to 15-45 µm. Re-float after regrinding (improved liberation, Cu recovery +2-5%). **Scavenger flotation:** Float rougher tailings (recover remaining copper, 3-10% additional recovery), low-grade concentrate returns to rougher feed (closed circuit). **Thickening:** Concentrate thickener (10-30m diameter), settle concentrate slurry from 10-20% to 50-65% solids (reduce water, minimize transport costs). Flocculant: anionic polyacrylamide (5-20 g/tonne solids). Underflow to filters. **Filtration:** Vacuum disc filters (4-8m diameter, 6-12 discs) or pressure filters (horizontal belt, plates), reduce moisture to 8-12%. Final concentrate: 25-32% Cu, 8-10% moisture, bulk density 1.4-1.8 t/m³.

**Step 96-115: Concentrate Drying and Smelter Feed Preparation**

**Drying (optional, if transport >100km or moisture spec <1%):** Rotary dryer (2-4m diameter, 10-25m long, inclined 3-5°, rotation 3-6 rpm), hot gas 400-700°C ([natural gas](natural-gas) combustion + dilution air), countercurrent flow. Evaporate water: moisture 8-10% → 0.2-1%. Temperature: product discharge 90-120°C (prevent oxidation, pyrophoric if too hot). Energy: 800-1,500 kJ/kg water (1.0-1.5 GJ/tonne concentrate for 8% moisture removal). Dust collection: cyclones + baghouse (fabric filters, <50 mg/Nm³ emission). **Sampling and assay:** Automatic samplers (cross-stream cutters, 1:100 to 1:500 split), composite sample every 50-200 tonnes. Assay: ICP-OES or AAS (atomic absorption) for Cu, Fe, S, Au, Ag, As, Sb, Bi (penalty elements). Moisture: oven dry at 105°C, weigh loss. **Blending:** Mix concentrates from multiple sources (in-house production, purchased concentrates) to achieve smelter feed specification (25-30% Cu target, <2% As+Sb+Bi, <0.1% Hg). Blending silos: 500-5,000 tonnes capacity, multiple compartments, reclaim with front-end loaders or conveyors. **Transport:** Truck to smelter (if co-located, 5-50km), or rail/ship (concentrate exports, Chile/Peru to Asia smelters, 5,000-10,000 km). Shipping: Handysize or Panamax bulk carriers (20,000-80,000 tonnes), moisture control (too wet = liquefaction risk, ship capsizing).

**Step 116-135: Flash Smelting - Copper Matte Production**

Convert copper concentrate to molten copper matte (50-70% Cu, liquid copper sulfide + iron sulfide mixture). **[Flash smelter](flash-smelter) design:** Outotec flash furnace (most common, 70% of global capacity), rectangular reaction shaft 4-6m wide, 8-15m long, 15-25m tall. Refractory lining: magnesia-chrome bricks (hot face 1,300-1,400°C), insulating firebrick backup, steel shell. **Feed preparation:** Dry concentrate (<1% moisture, prevent steam explosions) + silica flux (SiO₂, 2-8% of charge, forms fayalite slag Fe₂SiO₄). Pneumatic conveying to concentrate burners. **Burners:** 1-4 burners at furnace roof, inject concentrate + oxygen-enriched air (30-50% O₂ vs 21% air, from cryogenic air separation unit or PSA oxygen plant). Injection velocity: 80-150 m/s, atomizes concentrate to 10-100 µm droplets. **Flash reaction:** Particles combust in suspension (reaction time 0.5-2 seconds): 2CuFeS₂ + 4O₂ → Cu₂S + 2FeO + 3SO₂ + heat (exothermic, 1,250°C flame temperature). Iron oxidizes preferentially: FeS + 1.5O₂ → FeO + SO₂. Silica flux reacts: 2FeO + SiO₂ → Fe₂SiO₄ (fayalite slag, density 3.8 g/cm³ liquid). Copper remains as Cu₂S-FeS matte (density 5.0-5.5 g/cm³). **Settler zone:** Molten droplets fall into settler hearth (2-4m deep liquid bath, 1,200-1,250°C). Stratify by density: slag floats (30-40% Fe, 30-40% SiO₂, 0.8-1.5% Cu loss), matte sinks (50-70% Cu, 18-25% Fe, 20-25% S). Continuous tapping: matte every 1-4 hours (25-80 tonnes/tap, ladles transport to converters), slag every 2-6 hours (to slag granulation or discard). **Off-gas:** SO₂-rich gas (15-75% SO₂, 5-15% O₂, balance N₂) exits uptakes (1,100-1,300°C), heat recovery in waste heat boiler (generates steam 40-60 bar, 10-30 MW thermal), cool to 320-400°C, electrostatic precipitators capture dust (5-15% of feed Cu reports to dust, recycle).

**Step 136-155: Converting - Blister Copper Production**

Remove iron and sulfur from matte, produce crude copper. **Peirce-Smith converter:** Horizontal cylindrical vessel 4-5m diameter, 9-13m long, rotates on trunnions (tilt for charging/tapping), refractory lining (magnesia-chrome bricks). Capacity: 200-400 tonnes matte per batch. **Charging:** Tilt converter, pour molten matte (1,150-1,200°C) + silica flux (3-5% charge) + scrap copper (5-15%, coolant). Return to horizontal, rotate 90° (tuyere line submerged). **Slag blow (remove iron):** Inject air through tuyeres (12-40 submerged pipes, 50-80mm diameter, insert through shell), flowrate 10,000-30,000 Nm³/h, pressure 1.5-3.5 bar. Oxidize iron: 2FeS + 3O₂ → 2FeO + 2SO₂. FeO + SiO₂ → FeSiO₃ (iron silicate slag, density 3.5 g/cm³). Slag blow duration: 4-8 hours, temperature rises to 1,200-1,250°C (exothermic oxidation). Skim slag: tilt converter, pour slag into ladles (discard or recycle to flash furnace, recover 1-3% Cu content). Slag mass: 40-60% of original matte weight. Remaining: white metal (75-82% Cu, Cu₂S with minimal FeS). **Copper blow (remove sulfur):** Continue air injection, oxidize Cu₂S: Cu₂S + O₂ → 2Cu + SO₂ (exothermic, temperature 1,180-1,220°C). Reaction self-sustaining, no external fuel needed. Copper blow duration: 2-4 hours. Monitor: "flame color" (blue-green indicates copper, red indicates sulfur), sample analysis (dissolved oxygen DO 0.1-0.5%, sulfur <0.05%). Over-blowing risks: excessive Cu₂O formation (hard, brittle copper). **Blister copper:** Tap molten copper (1,150-1,200°C) into ladles or anode casting wheel. Composition: 98.5-99.5% Cu, 0.02-0.5% S, 0.05-0.5% O (as Cu₂O), 0.01-0.1% Fe, 0.001-0.01% Ag+Au (precious metals remain). Name: surface solidifies with blisters (SO₂ gas bubbles escape during cooling). Production rate: modern converters process 200-600 tonnes matte/day → 120-400 tonnes blister copper/day.

**Step 156-175: Anode Casting and Fire Refining**

**Anode casting wheel:** Rotary casting machine, 20-40 molds (copper or graphite-coated steel, 1,000×1,200×40mm anode size), rotate continuously (0.5-1 rpm). Pour molten blister copper into molds (300-400 kg per anode), water-cooled, solidify in 3-8 minutes, demold automatically. Casting rate: 200-500 anodes/hour. Anode quality: flat surfaces (uniform current distribution in electrorefining), 35-45mm thickness, clean (no slag inclusions, cracks). **Fire refining (optional, reduce oxygen):** Anode furnace (rotary or reverberatory, 100-500 tonnes capacity), remelt blister copper to 1,150-1,200°C. **Reducing (poling):** Insert green wood poles or inject natural gas/propane below surface. Decomposition produces CO + H₂ (reducing atmosphere): Cu₂O + CO → 2Cu + CO₂, Cu₂O + H₂ → 2Cu + H₂O. Reduces oxygen from 0.3-0.5% to 0.01-0.1% (tough-pitch copper, optimal for wire drawing). Over-reducing: hydrogen dissolves in copper, evolves during solidification (steam cavities, porosity). Poling time: 15-45 minutes, judge by "fracture test" (solidify sample, examine grain structure). **Oxidizing (optional, remove volatile impurities):** Blow air, oxidize As, Sb, Bi, Pb to oxides (volatile or skim as dross): 4As + 3O₂ → 2As₂O₃ (sublimes at 465°C, removed in off-gas). Drossing: skim surface dross (contains oxides, some Cu loss 3-8%). **Re-casting:** Cast fire-refined copper into anodes (same casting wheel process), or continuous casting for oxygen-free copper products.

**Step 176-195: Electrolytic Refining - High-Purity Copper**

Produce 99.99-99.999% pure copper via electrochemistry. **[Electrorefining cell](electrorefining-cell):** Concrete tank lined with lead, polypropylene, or PVC (acid-resistant), 1.2×4×1.3m dimensions, capacity 5-10m³. Electrolyte: copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄·5H₂O, 40-50 g/L Cu²⁺ as copper), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, 170-190 g/L, 1.8-2.2 M), temperature 60-65°C (heating coils or heat exchangers, optimal conductivity + diffusion). **Anodes:** Blister copper plates, 1,000×1,200×35mm, 300-400 kg, suspend vertically (copper hooks + stainless steel hanger bars). Spacing: 40-50 anodes per cell, 90-120mm center-to-center. Immersion depth: 1,000mm. Lifetime: 21-28 days (dissolves to 10-20mm thick remnant, recycle scrap anodes). **Cathodes:** Starter sheets (pure copper, 1,000×1,200×0.8mm, 5-7 kg, from stainless steel blanks in separate plating cell) or stainless steel permanent cathodes (ISA process, Kidd process). Interleave: alternating anode-cathode-anode-cathode (40-50 anodes, 41-51 cathodes per cell). **Current:** DC power supply (6,000-24,000 A per cell, 0.2-0.35 V per cell, multiple cells in series 100-400 cells = 60-140 kA total, 20-80V bus voltage). Current density: 200-350 A/m² (cathode surface area ~2.4m² per side = 1,000-1,700A per cathode). **Anode reaction (oxidation):** Cu (impure) → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻. Copper dissolves, enters electrolyte as Cu²⁺ ions (hydrated, Cu(H₂O)₆²⁺). Impurities: noble metals (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) don't dissolve (insoluble, fall to cell bottom as "anode slime" or "anode mud", 0.1-0.5% of anode mass, high-value byproduct $500-5,000/kg). Active metals (Fe, Ni, Zn, As, Sb, Bi) dissolve but less noble than copper (stay in solution or precipitate, don't plate on cathode). **Cathode reaction (reduction):** Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (pure). Copper plates onto cathode surface, crystal growth perpendicular to surface. Dendrites risk: high current density or low Cu²⁺ concentration causes branching growth (shorts anode-cathode). Prevent: maintain Cu²⁺ >40 g/L, add leveling agents (glue, thiourea 5-50 ppm smooths deposit). **Plating time:** 10-14 days, cathode grows to 70-100 kg (90-110mm thick). Harvest: crane lifts cathode, strip copper sheets (pull off starter sheets manually or hydraulic press). Inspect: flat, smooth, no nodules/shorts. Quality: 99.99% Cu (4N purity), <5 ppm Ag, <3 ppm S, <2 ppm O. Oxygen-free copper (OFC, 99.95% Cu, <10 ppm O): special low-oxygen anodes + tight process control. Cathode size: 1,000×1,200mm sheets, 70-100 kg, bundle 1-2 tonnes for shipment. **Electrolyte management:** Copper concentration: maintain 40-50 g/L (depletes as plating occurs, replenish by anodic dissolution, balance). Acid concentration: 170-190 g/L (rises as water electrolysis 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ at anode if Cu²⁺ too low, or add H₂SO₄ makeup). Impurity buildup: bleed 3-10% electrolyte/day, treat in liberator cells (plate copper at high current, precipitate As/Sb/Bi as arsenates/antimonates, discard pregnant solution or crystallize CuSO₄). Circulation: pumps circulate electrolyte 0.5-2 L/min per cell (uniform concentration, remove anode slime suspension). Filtration: cartridge filters remove slime particles, prevent cathode contamination. **Anode slime processing:** Collect slime from cell bottom (periodic vacuum dredging or drain cells), filter, dry. Composition: 15-50% Cu, 10-40% Ag, 0.01-1% Au, 5-20% Se+Te, 5-15% PbSO₄, 3-10% Ni/Fe oxides. Hydrometallurgical recovery: leach copper (H₂SO₄), precipitate silver (as AgCl), electrolytic gold recovery. Slime value: $200-1,500 per tonne blister copper processed (depends on precious metal content, offset refining costs 20-60%).

Copper electrorefining achieves 99.99% purity essential for electrical conductivity (impurities scatter electrons, reduce conductivity). Energy consumption: total 2,000-4,000 kWh/tonne refined copper (mining 200 kWh, grinding 600-800 kWh, smelting 300-500 kWh, electrorefining 250-350 kWh, auxiliaries 650-2,150 kWh). Price: $8,000-10,000/tonne ($8-10/kg, London Metal Exchange LME Grade A copper, volatile with economic cycles). Applications: electrical wire (50%, drawn to 0.1-10mm diameter), electronics/PCBs (20%, electrodeposited copper foil 9-70 µm), construction (15%, pipes, roofing, architectural), transport (5%, radiators, wiring harnesses), industrial machinery (10%, heat exchangers, motors, bearings). Recyclability: 100% recyclable, 40% of supply from scrap (lower energy 85%, identical properties to primary copper).
