# How to Make Copper Metal

Copper is extracted from copper ore (typically chalcopyrite) through mining, concentration, smelting, and electrolytic refining. The process purifies copper from 0.5-2% in ore to 99.99% pure metal used in electronics and wiring.

## What is it?

Pure copper metal (Cu) with 99.9-99.99% purity, used for electrical wiring, plumbing, heat exchangers, and electronic components. Copper has excellent electrical conductivity (second only to silver), thermal conductivity, and corrosion resistance. Available in various forms: ingots, rods, wire, foil, powder.

## Steps to Make:

**Mining:**
1. Mine [Copper Ore](copper-ore) from open-pit or underground mines
2. Typical ore: chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂) containing 0.5-2% copper
3. Blast rock face with explosives
4. Load broken ore into haul trucks (100-400 ton capacity)
5. Transport to primary crusher near mine
6. [Mining Workers](mining-labor) operate equipment 24/7 in shifts

**Crushing:**
7. Feed ore into [Crusher Equipment](ore-crusher) - jaw crusher or gyratory crusher
8. Primary crushing reduces boulder-sized ore (1 meter) to gravel (10-30cm)
9. Secondary crushing with cone crusher reduces to 1-3cm pieces
10. Tertiary crushing (if needed) to <1cm

**Grinding:**
11. Transport crushed ore to concentrator mill
12. Feed into [Ball Mill](grinding-mill) - rotating cylinder filled with steel balls
13. Mill rotates, steel balls crush ore into fine powder
14. Add water to create slurry
15. Grind until 80% of particles are <150 microns (like fine sand)
16. Grinding liberates copper minerals from waste rock
17. Powered by [Electricity](electricity) - ball mills consume huge power (5-10 MW)

**Flotation (Concentration):**
18. Pump ore slurry into [Flotation Cells](flotation-equipment) - large tanks with agitators
19. Add [Chemical Collectors](flotation-chemicals) - xanthates and other surfactants
20. Collectors selectively coat copper sulfide particles, making them hydrophobic
21. Inject air bubbles from bottom of cell
22. Hydrophobic copper particles attach to bubbles and float to surface
23. Hydrophilic waste rock (gangue) sinks to bottom
24. Skim froth from surface - contains concentrated copper minerals
25. Froth contains 20-30% copper (vs 0.5-2% in original ore)
26. This concentrate is ~10% of original ore weight - 90% waste discarded to tailings
27. Tailings pond stores waste rock slurry

**Drying:**
28. Filter concentrate to remove water
29. Dry in rotary dryer at 100-150°C
30. Result: copper concentrate powder

**Smelting (Extracting Copper from Sulfide):**
31. Transport concentrate to smelter facility
32. Feed concentrate into [Smelting Furnace](flash-smelter) - flash furnace or reverberatory furnace
33. Preheat furnace to 1,200-1,300°C using [Natural Gas](natural-gas) burners
34. Inject concentrate powder with oxygen-enriched air
35. Particles combust in mid-air (flash smelting)
36. Chemical reactions:
    - 2CuFeS₂ + 3O₂ → 2FeO + 2CuS + 2SO₂
    - Copper sulfide separates from iron oxide
37. Molten material settles in furnace bottom
38. Two layers form: copper matte (50-70% Cu) on bottom, slag (iron silicate) on top
39. Tap copper matte into ladles
40. Tap slag separately - sold as construction material or discarded
41. SO₂ gas captured and converted to [Sulfuric Acid](sulfuric-acid) (byproduct)
42. One ton of copper produces ~2 tons of sulfuric acid

**Converting (Removing Sulfur):**
43. Pour copper matte into converter furnace (Peirce-Smith converter)
44. Blow oxygen-enriched air through molten matte
45. Sulfur oxidizes and escapes as SO₂ gas
46. 2CuS + 3O₂ → 2Cu + 2SO₂
47. After 4-6 hours: blister copper (98-99% pure)
48. Called "blister" due to bubbles from dissolved gases
49. Tap molten blister copper into molds - forms anodes (large plates, 300-400 kg each)
50. Anodes cool and solidify

**Electrolytic Refining:**
51. Transport anodes to [Electrolytic Refining](electrorefining-cell) facility
52. Electrorefining cell: large tank filled with copper sulfate solution (CuSO₄ + H₂SO₄)
53. Immerse blister copper anodes (impure copper)
54. Alternate with thin cathode starter sheets (pure copper, 1mm thick)
55. Apply DC current (200-400 amps per square meter)
56. Powered by [Electricity](electricity)
57. Copper dissolves from anode: Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻
58. Copper ions migrate through solution
59. Copper plates onto cathode: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu
60. Impurities (gold, silver, nickel, iron) fall to cell bottom as "anode slime" or stay in solution
61. Refining voltage: 0.2-0.3V per cell
62. Current efficiency: 95-99%
63. After 10-20 days: cathodes grow to 100-150 kg
64. Remove cathodes from cell - now 99.99% pure copper
65. Anode slime collected and processed to recover precious metals (gold, silver)

**Melting and Casting:**
66. Melt cathodes in induction furnace at 1,200°C
67. Cast molten copper into desired forms:
    - Continuous casting for wire rod (8mm diameter, kilometers long)
    - Ingots (25-50 kg bars)
    - Billets for extrusion
    - Cake for rolling into sheet/foil
68. Oxygen-free copper: melt under reducing atmosphere to prevent dissolved oxygen

**Wire Drawing (for electrical wire):**
69. Heat wire rod to 800-900°C (annealing)
70. Draw through progressively smaller dies
71. Each pass reduces diameter by 10-30%
72. Anneal again after every 5-10 passes to restore ductility
73. Final wire: 0.1mm to 10mm diameter depending on application
74. Spool onto reels

**Foil Rolling (for circuit boards, batteries):**
75. Roll ingot between heavy rollers repeatedly
76. Each pass reduces thickness by 20-50%
77. Anneal periodically to prevent brittleness
78. Final thickness: 8-70 microns for copper foil
79. One side is drum-side (shiny), other is matte side (better adhesion)

**Quality Control:**
80. Test copper purity using spectroscopy
81. Electronic-grade copper: 99.99% (4N purity)
82. Oxygen-free copper (OFC): <10 ppm oxygen
83. Measure electrical conductivity: should be >100% IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard)
84. Pure copper at 20°C: 5.96 × 10⁷ S/m conductivity
85. Check for impurities: sulfur, oxygen, and trace metals affect conductivity

**Applications of Copper by Form:**
- Wire rod (8mm) → drawn to wire → electrical wiring, motors, transformers
- Foil (10-70 microns) → circuit boards (PCBs), lithium battery anodes
- Sheet (0.5-5mm) → roofing, plumbing, heat exchangers
- Tube (10-50mm) → plumbing pipes, refrigeration
- Powder → sintered parts, conductive inks, 3D printing

**Copper Production Scale:**
- Global production: 25-27 million tons per year
- Major producers: Chile (30%), Peru (12%), China (10%), USA (6%)
- Grade required:
  - Electrical wire: 99.9% (ETP - electrolytic tough pitch)
  - Electronics/semiconductors: 99.99-99.999% (4N-5N)
- Energy consumption: 2,000-4,000 kWh per ton of copper
- Water usage: 40-100 tons of water per ton of copper
- Mining to refined metal: 3-4 weeks
- Price: $8,000-10,000 per ton (fluctuates with market)

**Environmental Considerations:**
- Tailings: 90-98% of mined ore becomes waste
- SO₂ emissions: must be captured to prevent acid rain
- Water pollution: acid mine drainage contains dissolved metals
- Modern smelters capture >99% of SO₂ and convert to sulfuric acid
- Tailings dams must be managed for decades after mine closure
- Copper is 100% recyclable - recycling uses 85% less energy than primary production

**Recycling Copper:**
- Collect copper scrap: wire, pipe, electronic waste
- Sort by grade (clean copper vs alloys vs contaminated)
- Shred and remove non-copper materials
- Melt in furnace at 1,200°C
- Refine to remove impurities if needed
- Cast into ingots
- Recycled copper is identical to mined copper
- ~40% of global copper supply comes from recycling

Copper extraction is energy-intensive and generates large amounts of waste rock, but copper's recyclability and essential role in electronics, power transmission, and renewable energy make it indispensable. The electrorefining step is critical for achieving the 99.99% purity required for electronics - even 0.01% impurities significantly reduce electrical conductivity.
