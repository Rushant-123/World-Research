Lithium compound - precursor to lithium-ion batteries, ceramics, glass, pharmaceuticals, lubricants. Global production: 700,000 tonnes LCE (lithium carbonate equivalent, 2023). Two routes: brine evaporation (50-60% of supply, Chile, Argentina, China salt lakes) or hard rock mining (40-50%, Australia spodumene). Battery boom: demand grew 6× since 2015 (EVs, grid storage).

**Step 1-18: [Lithium Brine](brine-extraction) Sources and Pumping**
Lithium brines: underground aquifers in salt flats (salars) of arid regions. Atacama Desert Chile (Salar de Atacama, world's highest-grade 1,400-2,600 ppm Li), Uyuni Bolivia (9,000 km², largest salar, lower grade 250-450 ppm Li), Argentina puna (Salar de Hombre Muerto, Salar de Olaroz, Cauchari), China Qinghai (Qarhan salt lake, 300-500 ppm Li), Tibet Zabuye (1,400 ppm Li). Brine formation: lithium leached from volcanic rocks over millions of years, concentrated by evaporation in closed basins, no outlet (endorheic). Composition: Li 200-2,600 ppm, Mg 6,000-20,000 ppm (magnesium problematic, Mg/Li ratio important - Atacama 6:1 favorable, Argentina 10-20:1 challenging, China 40:1 very difficult), K 10,000-30,000 ppm (potassium chloride byproduct), Na 30,000-100,000 ppm, B 200-1,000 ppm (boron), SO₄²⁻ 10,000-50,000 ppm. **Extraction:** Drill production wells 20-200m deep into aquifer, pump brine to surface (submersible pumps, solar-powered or diesel generators). Flow rate: 10-100 L/s per well. Fresh brine: 1.15-1.25 g/cm³ density, slightly yellow or clear, pH 7-8.

**Step 19-42: [Solar Evaporation](solar-evaporation) in Pond Sequence**
Concentrate lithium by evaporating water (solar energy, free). Sequential evaporation ponds: 10-50 km² total area, 0.3-1.5m deep, lined (clay or HDPE if permeable substrate). **Stage 1 (pre-concentration):** Pump fresh brine (200-400 ppm Li) to first pond series. Solar evaporation rate: 3-8 mm/day (depends on climate - Atacama 8 mm/day high solar radiation + low humidity, Argentina 4-6 mm/day, China 3-5 mm/day). Residence time: 6-12 months per pond. Concentrate 3-5× (volume reduces, lithium concentration increases to 1,000-2,000 ppm). Halite (NaCl) crystallizes first (least soluble salt, 360 g/L solubility), precipitates as bottom crust 10-50 cm thick. Harvest halite periodically (scraper, vacuum truck), discard or sell as road salt. **Stage 2 (secondary concentration):** Decant supernatant brine (1,000-2,000 ppm Li, Mg/Li ratio 5-15) to next pond series. Evaporate 6-18 months. Potassium salts precipitate: sylvite (KCl, 340 g/L solubility), carnallite (KMgCl₃·6H₂O). Harvest as potash byproduct (fertilizer, $200-400/tonne). Brine: 3,000-6,000 ppm Li, Mg/Li ratio 3-10. **Stage 3 (final concentration):** Evaporate to 0.5-0.8% Li (5,000-8,000 ppm, Mg/Li <5 ideal but often 8-15 for non-Atacama). Total evaporation time: 12-24 months (Atacama optimum 14-18 months, Argentina/China 18-30 months due to lower evaporation rates, more magnesium).

**Step 43-65: Magnesium Removal (Critical Step)**
High Mg/Li ratio problematic: co-precipitates magnesium carbonate with lithium carbonate (contaminates product, reduces purity to <95% vs battery-grade spec >99.5%). **Selective precipitation:** Add slaked lime Ca(OH)₂ to concentrated brine. Mg²⁺ + Ca(OH)₂ → Mg(OH)₂ ↓ + Ca²⁺ (magnesium precipitates as brucite, Ksp 1.8×10⁻¹¹, removes 70-90% of Mg). Settling time: 12-48 hours in clarifier. Decant supernatant (reduced Mg/Li to <3). Mg(OH)₂ sludge disposal: tailings ponds (slurry 20-30% solids, highly alkaline pH 11-12). **Ion exchange (alternative, emerging):** Pass brine through ion-exchange resin columns (selective for Li⁺ over Mg²⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺). Proprietary resins: aluminum or manganese oxide based, adsorb Li⁺. Elute with dilute HCl, recover lithium chloride solution. Advantage: faster than evaporation (weeks vs 18 months), smaller footprint, works in humid climates. Disadvantage: capex $100-300M vs evaporation ponds $30-80M, chemical consumption (acid, base), resin degradation. Commercial plants: Livent Argentina (ion exchange), Standard Lithium (direct lithium extraction DLE pilots). **Solvent extraction (research):** Organic extractants (tributyl phosphate TBP, crown ethers) selectively extract lithium from brine. Lab-scale, not yet commercial-scale for lithium.

**Step 66-88: Lithium Carbonate Precipitation**
React lithium brine with [soda ash](sodium-carbonate) (sodium carbonate Na₂CO₃). Reaction: 2LiCl + Na₂CO₃ → Li₂CO₃ ↓ + 2NaCl (lithium carbonate precipitates, Ksp 8.15×10⁻⁴, sparingly soluble 13 g/L at 25°C). **Process:** Heat concentrated brine (5,000-8,000 ppm Li, Mg/Li <3) to 80-95°C in stirred [reactor tanks](chemical-reactor) (stainless steel or FRP, 50-200 m³). Add soda ash solution (10-20% Na₂CO₃, slight stoichiometric excess 10-20% to drive reaction). Agitate vigorously (200-400 rpm, 1-3 hours reaction time). Lithium carbonate precipitates as fine crystals (10-50 µm). Also precipitates: calcium carbonate CaCO₃ (from residual Ca²⁺), boron compounds (impurity). Cool to 40-60°C (further reduces solubility, increases yield). Yield: 90-95% of lithium precipitates. Mother liquor: sodium chloride + residual lithium (5-10% loss), recycle to ponds or dispose as waste brine. **Washing:** Filter slurry (filter press, rotary vacuum filter), wash cake with DI water (3-5 stages, remove entrained NaCl, MgCl₂, borates). Water consumption: 2-5 m³/tonne Li₂CO₃. Filter cake: 20-30% moisture.

**Step 89-110: Drying and Calcination**
**Spray drying:** Pump filter cake slurry (20-30% solids) to [spray dryer](spray-dryer) (rotary atomizer or nozzles, hot air 300-400°C, countercurrent or co-current flow). Droplets flash-dry in 5-20 seconds (instant evaporation, form hollow microspheres 50-200 µm). Exit air 100-120°C, product 80-100°C. Moisture: <0.5%. Throughput: 1-10 tonnes/hour. Product: battery-grade lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃), fine white powder, bulk density 0.5-0.7 g/cm³. **Rotary kiln drying (alternative):** Feed wet cake to rotary dryer, tumble in rotating cylinder with hot air or direct-fired flame (200-300°C, 20-60 minutes residence). Exit moisture <1%. Throughput: 5-50 tonnes/hour. **Calcination (if needed for purity):** Heat dry Li₂CO₃ to 500-700°C in rotary kiln or fluid bed (decompose residual bicarbonates, sulfates, organic impurities). Decomposes impurities but not lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃ stable to 1,300°C, melts at 723°C). Cool, mill if agglomerated.

**Step 111-130: Quality Control and Specifications**
**Battery-grade lithium carbonate:** 99.5-99.9% Li₂CO₃, <0.001% Ca, <0.001% Mg, <0.0015% Fe, <0.0005% Na, <0.001% K, <0.005% SO₄²⁻, <0.005% Cl⁻, <0.002% water-insolubles. Particle size: d₅₀ = 10-50 µm (median), narrow PSD. Moisture: <0.2%. Whiteness index: >90 (L* in CIE Lab color space). **Testing:** Titration for Li₂CO₃ content (dissolve in HCl, titrate with NaOH, methyl orange indicator). ICP-OES or ICP-MS for trace metals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, K, Al, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn each <10 ppm for battery-grade). Ion chromatography (IC) for anions (SO₄²⁻, Cl⁻). Laser diffraction for particle size. Karl Fischer titration for moisture. **Technical-grade (lower spec):** 99.0-99.5% Li₂CO₃, used in glass, ceramics, lubricant greases, air treatment (CO₂ absorption). Less stringent impurity limits (<0.01% each). Price: $10-20/kg (vs battery-grade $15-30/kg historical, spiked to $80/kg in 2022 supply crunch).

**Step 131-150: Hard Rock (Spodumene) Route - Alternative**
Spodumene: lithium aluminum silicate LiAlSi₂O₆, 8.03% Li₂O (equiv. 3.73% Li). Deposits: pegmatites (coarse-grained igneous intrusions). Western Australia: Greenbushes (world's largest, highest-grade 2-3% Li₂O in ore), Mt Marion, Mt Cattlin, Pilgangoora. Processing: **Mining:** Open pit, drill-blast-haul (similar to copper). Grade: 1-3% Li₂O in ore. **Beneficiation:** Crush, grind to -150 µm, heavy media separation or flotation (spodumene density 3.1-3.2 g/cm³ vs gangue 2.6-2.7). Oleic acid collector, pH 9-10. Concentrate: 6-7.5% Li₂O (75-90% recovery). **Calcination:** Heat concentrate to 1,050-1,100°C in rotary kiln (phase transformation, α-spodumene → β-spodumene, crystal structure change, β-form chemically reactive, expands 30%). **Leaching:** React β-spodumene with sulfuric acid at 200-250°C (pressure vessel). LiAlSi₂O₆ + H₂SO₄ → Li₂SO₄ + Al₂(SO₄)₃ + SiO₂. Dissolves lithium as sulfate. **Purification:** Precipitate aluminum as Al(OH)₃ with lime, filter. Precipitate lithium carbonate: Li₂SO₄ + Na₂CO₃ → Li₂CO₃ ↓ + Na₂SO₄. Wash, dry. Yield: 80-90% lithium recovery from spodumene. Cost: $5,000-10,000/tonne Li₂CO₃ (higher than brine $3,000-7,000/tonne in low-cost operations, but faster ramp-up, less climate-dependent).

**Step 151-165: Lithium Hydroxide Production (Alternative Product)**
Lithium hydroxide LiOH·H₂O: preferred for high-nickel cathodes (NMC811, NCA used by Tesla, Panasonic, high energy density). Conversion: Li₂CO₃ + Ca(OH)₂ → 2LiOH + CaCO₃ (lime causticization). **Process:** Slurry lithium carbonate in water (10-20% solids), add slaked lime Ca(OH)₂ (1.1:1 molar ratio Ca:Li₂CO₃). Heat to 80-95°C, stir 2-6 hours. LiOH dissolves (52.4 g/100mL at 20°C, very soluble), CaCO₃ precipitates (insoluble). Filter: separate CaCO₃ (waste or sell as precipitated chalk). Evaporate LiOH solution: multi-effect evaporators, concentrate to 30-50% LiOH. Crystallize by cooling: LiOH·H₂O crystals form (monohydrate, hexagonal prisms, 20-100 µm). Centrifuge, wash, dry at 100-120°C (remove surface moisture but not structural water). Product: battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate (56.5% LiOH·H₂O), 99.5-99.9% purity. **Anhydrous LiOH:** Heat monohydrate to 400-600°C (drive off water of hydration), quench cool (prevent moisture reabsorption), package in airtight containers or inert atmosphere (hygroscopic). Price: $20-40/kg (2015-2021 average, spiked to $85/kg in 2022). Conversion: 1 tonne Li₂CO₃ → 1.08 tonnes LiOH·H₂O.

**Step 166-180: Environmental and Social Issues**
**Water consumption:** Brine extraction + evaporation consumes 1-2 million liters water per tonne Li₂CO₃ (mostly evaporated from ponds, not consumed from freshwater - uses saline aquifer brine). Controversy: Atacama region (groundwater depletion concerns, indigenous Atacameño communities report wetland desiccation, flamingo habitat stress). Studies: brine extraction 10-100 L/s across salar (0.1-1% of aquifer flow), but cumulative effects over decades debated. **Land use:** Evaporation ponds: 10-50 km² per operation (solar farm scale, alters landscape, prevents other land uses). **Waste brines:** Mother liquor after precipitation: 10-20 m³ per tonne Li₂CO₃, high salinity (250-400 g/L TDS), return to evaporation ponds or inject to deep aquifer. Magnesium hydroxide sludge: 0.5-2 tonnes per tonne Li₂CO₃, alkaline pH 11-13, tailings ponds. **Spodumene tailings:** Mining generates 20-50 tonnes waste rock per tonne concentrate, acid leaching produces gypsum (CaSO₄), aluminum hydroxide sludge. **Carbon footprint:** Brine route 3-6 tonnes CO₂/tonne Li₂CO₃ (mostly natural gas for drying, electricity for pumps, soda ash production). Spodumene route 10-15 tonnes CO₂/tonne (energy-intensive mining, calcination, chemical processing). Lifecycle battery: 50-100 kg Li₂CO₃ per EV (3-15 tonnes CO₂ for lithium, 2-5% of vehicle lifecycle emissions, much smaller than fossil fuel combustion 50+ tonnes CO₂/vehicle over life).

**Step 181-195: Market, Pricing, and Outlook**
Global lithium demand: 700,000 tonnes LCE (2023), projected 2-3 million tonnes by 2030 (3-4× growth, driven by EVs, storage). Demand by sector: batteries 85% (EVs 60%, consumer electronics 15%, stationary storage 10%), ceramics/glass 8%, lubricants 3%, other 4%. Supply: Chile 30%, Australia 25%, China 15%, Argentina 10%, other 20%. **Price volatility:** 2015-2020: $6,000-13,000/tonne (stable supply, growing demand). 2021-2022: spike to $80,000/tonne (EV boom, supply bottlenecks, long lead times for new mines 5-10 years). 2023-2024: crash to $10,000-15,000/tonne (oversupply, China inventory buildup, demand slowdown). Cyclical commodity: 3-5 year price swings. **New supply projects:** Thacker Pass USA (lithium clay deposit, 80,000 tonne/year LCE by 2027), Cauchari-Olaroz Argentina (40,000 tpy), Kachi Argentina (ion exchange DLE), Mt Holland Australia (spodumene), Sonora Mexico (clay), Salinas Grandes Argentina (controversial, indigenous opposition). **Recycling:** EV batteries end-of-life 10-15 years, recycling emerging (95% lithium recovery via pyro or hydrometallurgy). 2030 projection: 10-20% of supply from recycling (200,000 tonnes LCE), reduces primary mining pressure. **Alternative chemistries:** Sodium-ion batteries (Na cheaper, abundant, lower performance but adequate for stationary storage, short-range EVs), lithium-sulfur (higher energy density, research stage), solid-state (lithium metal anode, glass or polymer electrolyte, 2× energy density, commercialization 2025-2030 target).

Price: $5/kg ($5,000/tonne) represents lower-end battery-grade lithium carbonate cost for established brine operations. Actual prices highly volatile: $10,000-80,000/tonne (2015-2024 range). Used in supply chain: lithium-ion batteries (laptops, phones, EVs, grid storage), specialty glass (low thermal expansion, Corningware, LCD glass), ceramics (fluxes, lower firing temperature), lubricating greases (lithium stearate, high-temperature stable), aluminum production (electrolyte additive), pharmaceuticals (lithium carbonate mood stabilizer, bipolar disorder medication). Per laptop battery: 50g Li₂CO₃ → $0.50-4.00 depending on lithium price. EV battery (75 kWh, ~50 kg Li₂CO₃): $500-4,000 just for lithium compound.
