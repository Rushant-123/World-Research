# How to Make Wafer Inspection System

Detects defects on wafers: particles, scratches, pattern defects, contamination. Critical for yield - single 50nm particle can kill a chip.

**Optical Inspection:** [High-Resolution Optics](high-resolution-optics) + [Laser Scanner](laser-system) scan wafer at high speed. [Image Processing](machine-vision) compares to golden reference or adjacent die. Detects defects >20nm. Speed: 100-200 wafers/hour.

**E-beam Inspection:** Electron beam scans, detects defects <10nm. Slower but higher resolution.

[Defect Classification](defect-classification): AI categorizes defects (particle, scratch, pattern missing, etc.). Maps defect locations. Yield analysis identifies problem tools/steps. Inspection systems: $5-20 million. Used after critical steps (lithography, etch, CMP). Modern fabs: 50-100 inspection points per wafer.
