Fundamental chemical - second most important industrial chemical after sulfuric acid. Uses: aluminum production (Bayer process, 15% of demand), pulp/paper (kraft process, 15%), organic chemicals (epoxy, polycarbonate, 20%), soaps/detergents (10%), water treatment (pH control, 8%), textiles (mercerization, 5%), food processing (peeling, cleaning, 3%), petroleum refining (2%), other 22%. Global production: 80 million tonnes/year (100% NaOH basis, 2023). Chlor-alkali process: electrolysis of salt brine, co-produces chlorine gas.

**Step 1-18: [Salt Brine](salt-mining) Preparation**
Raw material: sodium chloride (NaCl, common salt). Sources: rock salt mining (60%, underground halite deposits Michigan, Kansas, Texas, Germany, Poland), solar salt (30%, seawater evaporation ponds, Mediterranean, Middle East, Mexico), vacuum salt (10%, solution mining, highest purity). Purity requirements: >99.5% NaCl, <0.3% Ca²⁺, <0.15% Mg²⁺, <0.005% Fe, <0.02% SO₄²⁻ (alkaline earth metals poison ion-exchange membranes, reduce efficiency, cause scale formation). **Brine saturation:** Dissolve rock salt in water (saturator vessels, 5-20m diameter, 8-12m tall), recirculate water through salt bed until saturated (315-320 g NaCl/L at 20-25°C, 26-27% concentration). Fresh water input + recycled depleted brine (from electrolysis, 200-250 g/L NaCl after electrochemical reaction consumes 80-100 g/L). Temperature: 60-80°C (higher solubility 390 g/L at 100°C, but energy cost, operate 20-30°C). Residence time: 2-6 hours. **Clarification:** Gravity settling removes insoluble impurities (sand, clay, iron oxides, 1-24 hours in thickener tanks). Flocculants: polyacrylamide (5-20 ppm) agglomerate fine particles. Overflow: clear brine 315 g/L NaCl. Underflow: sludge to disposal.

**Step 19-42: Brine Purification (Critical Step)**
Remove divalent cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺) that foul membranes and anodes. **Caustic addition:** Add sodium hydroxide (5-10 g/L NaOH) + sodium carbonate (2-5 g/L Na₂CO₃) to saturated brine. Reactions: Ca²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CaCO₃ ↓ (calcium carbonate precipitates, Ksp 3.4×10⁻⁹). Mg²⁺ + 2OH⁻ → Mg(OH)₂ ↓ (magnesium hydroxide, brucite, Ksp 5.6×10⁻¹²). Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺ precipitate similarly. **Flocculation:** Add brine to reaction tanks (10-30 min residence), gentle agitation (50-100 rpm), form precipitate flocs. **Settling:** Clarifiers (20-50m diameter, 3-5m deep), 2-4 hours retention, flocs settle to bottom (sludge 10-20% solids). **Filtration:** Pressure sand filters (quartz sand media 0.5-2mm, bed depth 1-2m, flow rate 10-20 m³/h per m² area) or anthracite dual-media filters. Backwash periodically (reverse flow removes accumulated solids). Filtrate: purified brine <0.02 ppm Ca, <0.01 ppm Mg, <0.1 ppm Fe (membrane-grade specs, critical for 10,000+ hour membrane life vs 2,000 hours with poor purification). **pH adjustment:** Lower pH to 9-10 with HCl if excess caustic (high pH damages membranes, accelerates degradation). **Acidification (alternative, older diaphragm/mercury cells):** Add HCl to pH 3-4, removes Ca/Mg as soluble chlorides, then neutralize before electrolysis (less common, membrane cells dominate 70% of capacity, diaphragm 25%, mercury cells phased out <1% due to environmental concerns).

**Step 43-68: Chlor-Alkali Electrolysis - Membrane Cell Technology**
Electrolyze purified brine: 2NaCl + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂ + Cl₂ (electric current splits water, produces caustic + chlorine + hydrogen). **[Membrane cell](membrane-cell) design:** Most modern technology (70% of global capacity, replacing diaphragm/mercury cells). Divided cell with ion-selective [membrane](nafion-membrane) (Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid polymer, DuPont, or Aciplex, Asahi Glass). Membrane: 50-250 µm thick, sulfonate groups (–SO₃⁻) selectively transport Na⁺ cations, block OH⁻ and Cl⁻ anions (prevents mixing, maintains product purity). **Anode compartment:** Purified brine (310 g/L NaCl) fed continuously. Anode: dimensionally stable anode (DSA, [titanium substrate coated with mixed metal oxides](dimensionally-stable-anode) RuO₂-TiO₂ or IrO₂-Ta₂O₅, developed 1960s, replaced graphite anodes). Anode reaction: 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻ (chlorine gas evolves, 99.5-99.8% purity). Current density: 2-6 kA/m² (higher density = smaller cells but higher voltage, energy tradeoff). Temperature: 85-95°C (optimal conductivity, membrane performance). Depleted brine exits (200-220 g/L NaCl, recycled to saturators). **Cathode compartment:** Dilute caustic solution circulates (30-35% NaOH, 300-350 g/L). Cathode: nickel or nickel-coated steel mesh (catalyzes hydrogen evolution). Cathode reaction: 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻ (hydrogen gas + hydroxide ions). Sodium ions (Na⁺) transported through membrane from anode to cathode (charge balance), combine with OH⁻: Na⁺ + OH⁻ → NaOH. Product caustic: 32-35% NaOH exits cathode compartment. **Cell voltage:** 2.8-3.5V per cell (theoretical 2.19V, overpotentials + ohmic losses add 0.6-1.3V). Current efficiency: 93-96% (side reactions: oxygen evolution 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ at anode <5%, chlorate formation Cl₂ + 2OH⁻ → ClO⁻ + Cl⁻ + H₂O <2%). Power consumption: 2,000-2,500 kWh per tonne NaOH (largest operating cost, 40-60% of production cost). Electrolyzer: 50-200 cells in series (bipolar arrangement, metal partition acts as anode one side, cathode other side), total current 100-400 kA, DC power supply (rectifiers convert AC grid power).

**Step 69-90: Chlorine and Hydrogen Co-Product Handling**
Membrane cell co-products: 1 tonne NaOH + 0.886 tonnes Cl₂ + 0.025 tonnes H₂ (stoichiometric, 2:2:1 molar ratio). **Chlorine processing:** Gas exits anode compartment (saturated with water vapor, 85-90°C). Cool to 10-20°C in titanium heat exchangers (condenses water, separates as brine droplets). Dry chlorine: pass through concentrated sulfuric acid (98% H₂SO₄ absorbs water, gas exits <10 ppm H₂O). Compress: multi-stage compressors (carbon steel or titanium, 8-15 bar), intercoolers condense more water. Liquefy: cool to -35°C at 8-10 bar (chlorine condenses, boiling point -34°C at 1 atm). Store: pressurized tanks (liquid Cl₂, 1.4 g/mL density, ships in railcars, ISO containers, cylinders). Uses: PVC production (35% of chlorine demand), organics (EDC, phosgene, chloromethanes, 25%), bleaching/disinfection (pulp/paper, water treatment, 20%), inorganics (titanium dioxide, aluminum chloride, 10%), other 10%. Value: $200-600/tonne (volatile, often chlorine supply-demand dictates caustic production rates, chlor-alkali plants "swing" based on chlorine or caustic market). **Hydrogen processing:** Gas exits cathode compartment (wet, 85-90°C, 99-99.5% H₂, 0.5-1% O₂ contamination from electrolyte). Cool, dry (similar to chlorine, H₂SO₄ drying or molecular sieve). Purify: pressure swing adsorption (PSA, zeolite adsorbent removes N₂, O₂ → 99.9-99.999% H₂). Compress to 20-200 bar. Uses: on-site energy (burn in boilers, generate steam for evaporation, 40-50% of H₂), ammonia synthesis (20-30%), petroleum refining (hydrocracking, desulfurization, 15%), methanol production (10%), sell as industrial hydrogen (5%). Value: $1-3/kg (but transport cost high, prefer on-site use).

**Step 91-112: Caustic [Concentration](concentrator-equipment) (Evaporation)**
Membrane cell produces 32-35% NaOH (320-350 g/L). Most applications require 50% (500 g/L, "50% caustic," trade concentration, liquid, ships in tankers, railcars) or 98-99% (solid, flakes, prills). **Multi-effect evaporation:** Series of 2-5 evaporator vessels (falling-film or forced-circulation, stainless steel or nickel-clad). First effect: heat with steam (120-150°C, 2-4 bar), boil water off, concentrate caustic to 40-42%. Vapor from first effect heats second effect (lower pressure 0.5-1 bar, boiling point 100-110°C), concentrate to 48-50%. Optionally third effect (vacuum 0.1-0.3 bar, 60-80°C) for final concentration. Energy efficiency: 3-5 effects use 0.3-0.6 tonnes steam per tonne water evaporated (vs 1.0-1.2 for single effect). **High-concentration evaporation:** Concentrate beyond 50% requires higher temperatures (50% NaOH boiling point 145°C at 1 atm, 73% 190°C, 98% 300°C). Nickel or high-nickel alloy evaporators (Hastelloy, Monel, stainless corrodes >50% NaOH + high temp). Direct-fired evaporators or molten salt heating (safer than high-pressure steam >15 bar). **50% caustic:** Most common commercial form, 500 g/L NaOH, 1.52 g/mL density, viscous liquid, freezing point 12°C (must heat tankers/railcars in winter, steam coils or electric tracing). Ships in: mild steel, stainless, nickel-lined tankers, drums, IBCs. **Solid caustic (98-99%):** Evaporate to 98% (almost anhydrous), spray into flaker drum (rotating cooled drum, thin film solidifies, scraper removes flakes 1-3mm thick), or prill tower (droplets fall through cool air, solidify as spheres 1-5mm). Hygroscopic: absorbs CO₂ and moisture from air (forms Na₂CO₃ carbonate, dilutes), package immediately in moisture-proof bags (polyethylene-lined multiwall paper, 25kg bags) or airtight drums. Purity: 98-99% NaOH, 0.5-1.5% Na₂CO₃, <1% NaCl, <0.005% Fe, <0.002% heavy metals.

**Step 113-135: Alternative Technologies - Diaphragm and Mercury Cells**
**Diaphragm cell (25% of capacity):** Older technology (1890s invention, still used but declining). Divided cell with porous asbestos diaphragm (or polymer substitute) separates anode and cathode. Brine flows from anode through diaphragm to cathode (pressure gradient). Anode: DSA (titanium RuO₂), produces Cl₂. Cathode: steel screen, produces H₂ + OH⁻. Product: caustic exits cathode as 10-12% NaOH contaminated with 12-15% NaCl (salt + caustic mix, diaphragm allows some mixing). Evaporate to 50%: salt crystallizes out (solubility in caustic lower than in water, NaCl precipitates as "salt cake"), separate by filtration or centrifuge. Final: 50% NaOH with 1-2% NaCl (lower purity than membrane caustic <100 ppm NaCl). Advantages: lower capital cost, tolerates brine impurities better. Disadvantages: asbestos hazard (replacement polymers less durable, higher voltage), higher energy (3,000-3,500 kWh/tonne NaOH vs 2,000-2,500 membrane), lower purity. **Mercury cell (<1%, phasing out):** Flowing mercury cathode (liquid Hg, sodium dissolves forming Na-Hg amalgam), titanium anode produces Cl₂. Amalgam flows to separate decomposer (reacts with water, produces pure caustic + regenerates Hg). Product: 50% NaOH ultra-high purity (<10 ppm NaCl, <1 ppm metals). Advantages: highest purity (pharma, electronics), co-product hydrogen very pure. Disadvantages: mercury emissions (toxic, Minamata disease history), environmental regulations (EU banned new mercury cells 2010s, phase out existing by 2025), higher energy (3,200-3,800 kWh/tonne), high capital/operating cost (mercury recovery, monitoring). Only 5-10 plants remain globally (Japan, India, legacy plants, retrofitting to membrane cells $100-300M capex).

**Step 136-155: Caustic Applications - Aluminum Production (Bayer Process)**
Largest single use: 15% of global caustic demand (12 Mt/year NaOH). [Bayer process](aluminum-oxide) extracts alumina (Al₂O₃) from bauxite ore. Digest bauxite in hot caustic: Al(OH)₃ + NaOH → NaAlO₂ + 2H₂O (140-250°C, 3-10 bar, gibbsite or boehmite dissolves as sodium aluminate). Precipitate: cool solution, Al(OH)₃ crystallizes, caustic recovered (95% recycling, 5% losses to red mud, sodalite formation). Consumption: 10-30 kg NaOH per tonne Al₂O₃ (makeup losses, depends on bauxite silica content). Alumina plants: 140 Mt/year capacity → 1.4-4.2 Mt NaOH demand. Integrated chlor-alkali plants often co-locate with alumina refineries (Australia, Brazil, Jamaica).

**Step 156-175: Pulp and Paper - Kraft Process**
Second-largest use: 15% of caustic (12 Mt/year). Kraft (sulfate) process: digest wood chips in "white liquor" (NaOH + Na₂S sodium sulfide mixture, 160-180°C, 1-3 hours). Lignin dissolves, cellulose fibers remain. Spent liquor ("black liquor"): evaporate, burn in recovery boiler (generates steam + reduces Na₂SO₄ to Na₂S). Smelt: Na₂CO₃ + Na₂S, dissolve in water, add lime Ca(OH)₂: Na₂CO₃ + Ca(OH)₂ → 2NaOH + CaCO₃ (causticizing, regenerates caustic). Makeup NaOH: 5-15 kg/tonne pulp (losses to process, inefficiencies). Pulp production: 190 Mt/year → 1.0-2.8 Mt NaOH makeup + 10-20 Mt internal recycling.

**Step 176-185: Environmental, Safety, and Handling**
**Hazards:** Corrosive (pH 14, strong alkali, saponifies fats, dissolves proteins → severe skin/eye burns, blindness if contact). Exothermic dissolution in water (mixing solid NaOH + water releases 44 kJ/mol heat, solution heats to boiling, can splash). Reacts with Al, Zn, Sn (dissolves metals, generates H₂ gas, fire/explosion risk). **Exposure limits:** OSHA ceiling 2 mg/m³ (aerosol mist in air), immediate danger to life 10 mg/m³. **PPE:** Splash goggles + face shield, nitrile or neoprene gloves, chemically resistant apron/suit, safety shower/eyewash within 10 seconds. **Storage:** Mild steel tanks (NaOH forms protective iron oxide layer, compatible <100°C), polyethylene (HDPE, PP) containers. Avoid: aluminum, zinc, tin, glass (etches glass over time). Liquid: 50% caustic in heated tankers (maintain >15°C, prevent solidification). Solid: airtight packaging (prevent carbonate formation from CO₂). **Spill response:** Neutralize with dilute acid (acetic, citric, HCl, slowly to avoid heat/splattering), then wash with water. **Wastewater:** Neutralize with acid (H₂SO₄ or HCl to pH 6-9) or CO₂ (flue gas bubbling, forms Na₂CO₃), then discharge. **Carbon footprint:** 0.8-1.5 tonnes CO₂e per tonne NaOH (electricity dominates, 2,200 kWh at 0.4-0.7 kg CO₂/kWh grid mix = 0.9-1.5 t CO₂). Chlorine co-product offsets emissions if utilized (avoided production elsewhere). Low-carbon caustic: hydropower (Iceland, Norway, Canada), nuclear (France), solar (Middle East pilots), green hydrogen from electrolysis (avoid fossil fuel steam).

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Economics**
Global caustic soda: 80 Mt/year (100% NaOH basis, 2023). China: 38 Mt (48%), USA: 11 Mt (14%), EU: 9 Mt (11%), Japan: 4 Mt (5%), India: 4 Mt (5%), other 14 Mt (17%). Integrated producers (90%): caustic + chlorine sold together, economics tied (ECU "electrochemical unit" pricing, balances chlorine/caustic values). Merchant producers (10%): sell caustic only (chlorine byproduct used internally or vented/destroyed if no market, rare). **Price:** $200-600/tonne (50% caustic basis, 2010-2024 range), volatile. Recent: $350-500/tonne (long-term contracts), $400-700/tonne (spot). Higher in chlorine-deficit markets (China, Southeast Asia, caustic import needed), lower in chlorine-surplus (Middle East, Latin America, chlorine demand weak). **Cost structure:** electricity 45-55%, salt 5-10%, membrane/anode replacement 5-8%, labor/overhead 10-15%, chlorine credit (negative cost, offsets 20-40%), capex amortization 10-15%. Breakeven: $250-400/tonne (depends on electricity cost $30-80/MWh, chlorine value $200-600/tonne). Energy-intensive: 2,200 kWh/tonne NaOH (electricity $66-176/tonne at $30-80/MWh), largest cost component. Regions with cheap power (hydroelectric, natural gas) have advantage (Middle East, Norway, USA Gulf Coast). **Trade:** 25% of production traded internationally (20 Mt/year), exports from Middle East (Saudi, Iran), USA, EU, imports to China, India, Southeast Asia. **Outlook:** Demand growth 2-3% per year (driven by aluminum, chemicals, pulp/paper in emerging economies). Membrane cell adoption continues (replacing diaphragm, improving efficiency 2,000 kWh target vs 2,500 current). Chlorine-caustic balance: PVC demand (construction, packaging) drives chlorine → excess caustic, or alumina boom → tight caustic supply.

Price: $0.35/kg ($350/tonne) represents 50% caustic soda liquid, typical long-term contract price. Actual range $200-700/tonne depending on market cycle, region, purity, concentration. Used in: aluminum production (Bayer process alumina refining, largest single application), pulp/paper (kraft pulping, bleaching), chemicals (epoxy resins, polycarbonates, propylene oxide, sodium cyanide, zeolites), soaps/detergents (saponification of fats), petroleum refining (amine treating, alkylation catalyst), water treatment (pH adjustment, neutralization), textiles (mercerization of cotton, scouring, bleaching), food processing (hominy, lutefisk, pretzel glazing, pH control). Per tonne alumina: 10-30 kg NaOH makeup → $3.50-10.50 caustic cost component.
