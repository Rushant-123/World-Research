# How to Make Packaging Materials

Product packaging protects during shipping and presents brand image. MacBook packaging includes: outer corrugated box, internal molded fiber tray, protective films, manuals, accessories, and Apple stickers. Designed for minimal waste and recyclability.

## What is it?

Multi-layer packaging system. Outer [Cardboard Box](cardboard-box) (corrugated cardboard) protects from impacts. Molded pulp or [Foam Inserts](foam-packaging) cradle product. [Protective Film](protective-film) prevents scratches. [Printed Manual](printed-manual) and [Product Labels](product-labels) provide information. [Packaging Tape](packaging-tape) seals box. Apple packaging emphasizes sustainability - 100% recycled/renewable materials, minimal plastic.

## Manufacturing Steps (see inputs for detailed processes):
Each packaging component has its own supply chain. Cardboard from trees → pulp → corrugated board. Foam from petroleum → polyethylene/polyurethane. Printing from paper → offset/digital printing. Assembly happens at product manufacturing site where all packaging components converge for final packing.
