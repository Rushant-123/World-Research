# How to Make Silica Sand

High-purity quartz sand - silicon dioxide (SiO₂) >95%. Uses: glass manufacturing (soda-lime, container, flat glass, 40%), hydraulic fracturing proppant (oil/gas wells, 30%), foundry casting molds (metal casting, 15%), construction aggregate (concrete, mortar, 8%), ceramics, fillers, abrasives, water filtration (3%), electronics silicon (ultrapure, <1%), other 3%. Global production: 300 million tonnes/year (2023, industrial silica sand, excludes common construction sand). USA 40%, China 15%, Turkey 5%, others 40%.

**Step 1-18: Geology and Formation of Silica-Rich Sands**
Quartz (SiO₂ mineral, alpha-quartz polymorph room temp, Mohs hardness 7, melting point 1,670-1,710°C, extremely stable chemically). Abundance: 12% of Earth's crust, second most common mineral after feldspars. **Sand formation:** Weathering of quartz-bearing igneous rocks (granite, rhyolite contain 20-40% quartz), metamorphic (quartzite 90-99% quartz), sedimentary (sandstone). Physical breakdown (freeze-thaw, thermal expansion, abrasion in rivers/waves) disintegrates rock, transports quartz grains. Chemical weathering removes feldspars, micas (dissolve in acidic water, form clays), leaves resistant quartz enriched (mature sediments >95% quartz). **High-purity deposits:** Require multiple cycles weathering + transport + deposition (remove impurities Fe₂O₃ iron staining, feldspar, heavy minerals). (1) Ancient beach/dune sands (Ordovician St Peter Sandstone Illinois/Wisconsin, 99.5-99.8% SiO₂, white, friable, premier glass sand deposit globally, 475 Mya). (2) Fluvial/alluvial sands (river channel deposits, sorted by current, coarse 0.5-2mm, rounded grains). (3) Marine shelf sands (shallow sea deposits, wave-winnowing removes fines, concentrates quartz). **Specifications for high-grade:** SiO₂ >99%, Fe₂O₃ <0.02-0.05% (iron critical, colors glass green/brown at >100 ppm, acceptable in container glass, unacceptable in flint clear or optics), Al₂O₃ <0.5%, TiO₂ <0.05%, heavy minerals <0.05% (chromite, ilmenite, magnetite, zircon undesirable), refractory oxides (Cr₂O₃, CoO, NiO each <5 ppm for specialty glass).

**Step 19-40: [Open Pit Mining](open-pit-mining) and Dredging**
Silica sand deposits: unconsolidated loose sand (dredge or doze) or weakly cemented sandstone (blast + excavate). **Surface mining (70% of production):** Overburden removal (topsoil 0.2-1m, save for reclamation, subsoil/clay 1-10m, strip with dozers or scrapers). Expose sand layer (5-50m thick). Mine with front-end loaders (10-20 m³ buckets, load trucks), or bulldozers push to wash plant (if adjacent <500m). Dry mining: suitable if sand 2-10% moisture (free-flowing, no water table). Wet mining: if water table intersects deposit or high moisture, pump water, mine in wet conditions (more slurry handling). Production rate: 100,000-5,000,000 tonnes/year per mine (small specialty glass sand 100k tpy, large frac sand 3-5 Mt/year Wisconsin/Texas). **Dredging (30%):** For deposits below water table or submerged (rivers, lakes, offshore). Cutterhead suction dredge (rotating cutter head 3-10m diameter, loosens sand, suction pipe 300-600mm diameter, pump slurry 10-30% solids to processing barge or onshore plant, 500-3,000 m³/hour). Trailing suction hopper dredge (offshore, draghead on seafloor, 1-10 km offshore, fill hopper 5,000-30,000 m³, transport to shore or direct to wash plant via pipeline). Bucket dredge (grab dredge, for smaller operations or hard bottom, 1-5 m³ buckets). **Reclamation:** Backfill pits with tailings (fines, oversize, out-of-spec material), recontour to original grade or create lakes (groundwater fills pit if below water table, recreational use, wildlife habitat). Topsoil replacement, revegetate, 3-10 years post-mining, $5,000-30,000/hectare.

**Step 41-65: [Washing](sand-washing) and Classification**
Remove clay, silt, organic matter, weak particles. **Primary washing:** Trommel screen or log washer (rotating drum 2-5m diameter, 5-15m long, 10-25 rpm, water spray jets, tumbling action scrubs clay coatings off sand grains, -1mm fines + clay slurry overflows, +1mm sand advances). Water consumption: 2-5 m³/tonne sand (recycled 80-95% via clarifiers, makeup 0.1-0.5 m³/tonne). **Attrition scrubbing:** High-intensity attrition cells (mechanical agitation, sand-on-sand abrasion, 10-20 min residence, 60-75% solids, removes surface staining iron oxides, clays adhering to grain surfaces). **Sizing (screening):** [Vibrating screens](vibrating-screen) (multi-deck, 2-5 decks, separate size fractions). Glass sand typically 0.1-0.6mm (100-600 µm, 30-140 mesh USA sieve). Frac sand 0.4-0.85mm (40-70 mesh, narrower size distribution critical, 0.4-0.6mm "40/70 mesh" most common, or 0.6-0.85mm "20/40 mesh"). Reject oversize >1mm (return to crusher if weak sandstone, discard if strong pebbles quartz but out-of-spec). Reject fines <0.1mm (slimes, discard to settling pond). **Hydraulic classification (optional):** Spiral classifiers or hydrocyclones (density + size separation, remove heavy minerals magnetite, ilmenite, chromite if present 0.01-0.5%, reduce to <0.05%, improves purity). **Magnetic separation:** Wet high-intensity magnetic separator WHIMS (permanent magnets 1-2 Tesla or electromagnets, removes paramagnetic iron-bearing minerals magnetite Fe₃O₄, ilmenite FeTiO₃, hematite Fe₂O₃, biotite mica). Pass sand slurry through magnetic field (Fe minerals attracted, collect in bins, clean quartz flows through). Reduces Fe₂O₃ from 0.05-0.15% to 0.01-0.04% (critical for flint glass, optics, solar-grade silicon).

**Step 66-88: [Drying](rotary-dryer) and Final Processing**
Washed sand: 10-25% moisture (surface water + interstitial water between grains). Must dry to <0.5-2% for storage, pneumatic conveying, customer specs (moisture causes clumping, freezing in railcars winter, microbial growth if organics present). **Rotary dryer:** Inclined rotating cylinder (2-3m diameter, 10-30m length, 3-8 rpm, internal lifters cascade sand through hot gas stream). Heat source: natural gas burner (direct-fired 500-900°C flame, dilute to 150-400°C with ambient air), or indirect (steam tubes, less common, avoids combustion products contact but lower efficiency). Countercurrent flow (sand enters hot end, travels to cool exit, gas enters cool end, exits hot, maximizes heat transfer efficiency). Feed rate: 20-150 tph (residence 10-30 min). Exit moisture: 0.1-1% (below 0.5% for frac sand, <0.2% for premium glass sand). Exit temperature: 50-90°C (cool enough for conveyor belts, packaging, avoid thermal shock if hot sand contacts cold moisture condenses). **Cooling:** Fluid bed cooler or rotary cooler (ambient air, reduce to <40°C if immediate packaging/shipping). **Dust collection:** Baghouse filter on dryer exhaust (capture fines <100 µm entrained in gas stream, 99.9% removal, avoid PM10 emissions <0.01 g/m³ stack). Return fines to product or discard if out-of-spec. **Screening (final):** Dry screening (single or double-deck, ensure product within target size range, 20/40 mesh, 40/70 mesh, 100 mesh, etc.). Out-of-spec fractions (oversize/undersize) recycle to wet circuit or sell as lower-grade.

**Step 89-110: Hydraulic Fracturing Proppant (Largest Use 30%)**
Frac sand: 100-120 Mt/year USA (2015-2023 shale boom, Permian Basin Texas, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Marcellus/Utica Appalachia). Holds fractures open in shale formations, allows oil/gas flow. **Specifications:** Roundness (sphericity >0.7 Krumbein scale, rounded grains pack without crushing). Crush resistance (API RP 19D standard, 4,000-14,000 psi stress, <10% fines generation, Wisconsin/Ottawa sands strongest, poorly cemented sands fail). Size: 20/40 mesh (0.425-0.850mm, 50% of market), 40/70 mesh (0.212-0.425mm, 35%), 30/50 mesh (0.30-0.60mm, 10%), 100 mesh (0.15mm, 5% tail-end proppant). Purity: >99% SiO₂ preferred but 95-98% acceptable if crush strength adequate. Acid solubility: <5% dissolves in HCl/HF (carbonate cement, feldspars dissolve, leaves fines that plug fractures, reject high-carbonate sands). **Production regions:** Wisconsin/Illinois (St Peter sandstone, highest quality, 20-30 Mt/year), Texas (Hickory sandstone, in-basin, lower freight 20-25 Mt/year), Arkansas (15 Mt/year), others (Oklahoma, Minnesota). **Well consumption:** 2,000-10,000 tonnes sand per horizontal well (older 2010-2015 average 3,000 tonnes, modern 2020+ high-intensity fracs 8,000-15,000 tonnes per well, "super-fracs" maximize reservoir contact, 30-50 stages per well, 200-400 tonnes sand per stage). **Logistics:** Unit trains (100-120 railcars × 100 tonnes = 10,000-12,000 tonnes, mine to wellsite 500-2,500 km, $15-40/tonne freight depending on distance, oil price), or truck (short-haul <200 km, in-basin Texas sand advantage $5-15/tonne freight vs Wisconsin $20-40/tonne). Silo storage at wellsite (vertical steel silos 500-2,000 tonnes each, 4-8 silos per pad, pneumatic convey to blender van, mix with water + friction reducer, pump into well at 8,000-12,000 psi, 60-120 barrels per minute, 1-3 hours per stage). **Market volatility:** Tied to oil price + drilling activity (2014 oil $100/bbl → 15,000 wells/year, frac sand $100-180/tonne, 2016 crash oil $30/bbl → 5,000 wells, sand $30-60/tonne, 2018-2019 rebound $60-70 oil → 12,000 wells, sand $40-80/tonne, 2020 pandemic collapse, 2021-2024 recovery oil $70-90 → 10,000-13,000 wells, sand $35-70/tonne). Competition: resin-coated proppant (RCP, epoxy coating prevents flowback, 5× price $200-500/tonne, 10% market), ceramic proppant (sintered bauxite, high-strength 10,000+ psi, $600-2,000/tonne, <5% market deepest/hottest wells), local in-basin sand displaced Wisconsin (cost advantage, sufficient performance for most applications).

**Step 111-130: Glass Manufacturing (40% of Industrial Silica)**
Silica sand: 50-75% of glass batch weight (varies by glass type, soda-lime container 60-70% sand, flat glass 70-75%, fiberglass 55-65%). **Specifications:** (1) Soda-lime glass (bottles, windows): SiO₂ 99.0-99.5%, Fe₂O₃ <0.03-0.08% (amber/green container tolerates 0.05-0.08%, flint clear <0.03%), Al₂O₃ <1%, grain size 0.1-0.6mm (80% passing 0.3mm, fine sand melts faster, reduces furnace energy). (2) Flat glass (architectural, automotive): SiO₂ >99.3%, Fe₂O₃ <0.015% (ultra-low iron ULE glass, 0.012-0.015% Fe for extra-clear glazing, solar panel cover glass), consistent sizing. (3) Fiberglass (insulation, composites): SiO₂ 60-65% of batch (balance limestone, borax, alumina), Fe₂O₃ <0.15% acceptable (color not critical, performance-driven). (4) Specialty (optics, laboratory ware, photovoltaics): SiO₂ >99.8%, Fe₂O₃ <0.005-0.012%, Al₂O₃ <0.1%, Cr₂O₃/CoO/NiO each <1 ppm (colorants strictly controlled). **Melting:** Batch (sand + soda ash Na₂CO₃ + limestone CaCO₃ + cullet recycled glass) fed to furnace (regenerative or oxy-fuel, 1,450-1,600°C, residence 24-48 hours, silica dissolves into molten soda-lime glass 72% SiO₂ + 14% Na₂O + 9% CaO + 4% MgO + 1% Al₂O₃). Refining: bubbles rise, homogenize, 1,500°C peak (minimize seeds, stones, cords defects). **Consumption:** Global glass 180 Mt/year (container 60 Mt, flat 75 Mt, fiber 30 Mt, specialty 15 Mt) consumes 120-135 Mt silica sand.

**Step 131-148: Foundry Sand (Metal Casting 15%)**
Molding sand: shape molds + cores for casting molten metal (iron, steel, aluminum, bronze). **Properties required:** Refractoriness (withstand 1,200-1,600°C molten metal without melting or fusing), grain shape (rounded grains pack dense, angular lock together, subangular common 0.6-0.8 sphericity), permeability (allow gas escape from mold cavity during pour, prevent blowholes in casting), collapsibility (mold breaks apart easily after solidification, facilitates shake-out). **Grain size:** 40-140 mesh (0.1-0.4mm typical, finer for precision castings, coarser for large iron castings). GFN (grain fineness number) 50-70 typical (weighted average of size distribution, higher = finer). **Types:** (1) Green sand (90% of tonnage): silica sand 85-95% + bentonite clay 5-10% (binder) + water 2-5% + coal dust 2-5% (carbonaceous additive prevents metal-mold reaction, lustrous carbon layer). Reuse 95-98% of sand after shake-out (thermal reclamation or mechanical attrition to remove binder residue, makeup 2-5% new sand per cycle). (2) Resin-bonded sand (10%, precision casting): silica sand + phenolic or furan resin 1-3%, chemical cure or heat cure (CO₂ gas or amine catalyst), high dimensional accuracy, complex cores. Discard after one use (resin pyrolyzes at casting temp, sand not reusable without extensive thermal reclamation). **Specifications:** SiO₂ >97-99% (lower than glass sand, cost-sensitive), Fe₂O₃ <0.5% acceptable, grain shape critical (Ottawa sand Illinois benchmark rounded 0.85 sphericity, premium foundry sand, but Western sands 0.6-0.7 adequate most applications lower cost). **Consumption:** 30-40 Mt/year (USA 10-12 Mt, China 15-20 Mt, others 5-8 Mt, declining with casting industry shift to China, aluminum displacing iron reduces sand intensity per tonne metal).

**Step 149-165: Specialty Applications**
**Filtration sand (2-3 Mt/year):** Water treatment plants, swimming pools, rapid sand filters (remove suspended solids). Specifications: rounded grains 0.5-1.2mm (effective size d₁₀ = 0.45-0.55mm, uniformity coefficient <1.7), high purity 98-99.5% SiO₂ (avoid dissolution if pH extremes), crushed angular silica acceptable if washed (less common, rounded preferred for lower head loss, easier backwash). Depth: 0.6-1.2m sand bed, support gravel layer below (graded 2-25mm, prevent sand loss through underdrain). Backwash: reverse flow 10-15 m/hour (expand bed 20-30%, fluidize, wash accumulated solids to waste, 3-10 min every 1-4 days). Replace 5-10% per year (attrition fines, loss during backwash). **Abrasive blasting (2 Mt/year):** Sandblasting steel structures (remove rust, paint, mill scale), surface prep for coating. Grain size 0.3-1.2mm (coarse for heavy rust removal, fine for delicate surfaces). Hazard: silica dust (crystalline silica <10 µm respirable, chronic inhalation causes silicosis lung disease, scarring, irreversible, fatal, OSHA PEL 50 µg/m³ 8-hour TWA, engineering controls + respirators mandatory, alternatives garnet, steel shot, glass beads safer). **Ceramics (5 Mt/year):** Body ingredient (clay + feldspar + silica), reduces shrinkage, improves workability, 10-30% of porcelain, 15-40% of earthenware. Grain size 10-100 µm (ground silica flour). **Construction mortar/concrete (300+ Mt/year, but mostly common sand not high-purity industrial silica sand, $5-15/tonne vs industrial $20-100/tonne, excluded from this page focus).**

**Step 166-175: Electronics-Grade Silicon (Ultra-High Purity)**
Semiconductor/solar-grade silicon requires ultrapure metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si) as precursor, derived from high-purity quartz. **Quartz source:** Pegmatites, hydrothermal veins (>99.95% SiO₂, <50 ppm impurities total, <1 ppm B, P, As each critical dopants). Norway, USA North Carolina, Brazil Minas Gerais. Mine: underground or open pit, hand-sort high-purity lumps (discard weathered, stained, fractured quartz). Crush to 10-100mm lumps. **Metallurgical silicon production:** Electric arc furnace (submerged arc, 2,000-2,200°C, three graphite electrodes 1-2m diameter, 20-40 MW, batch size 10-50 tonnes Si). Charge: quartz lumps + carbon (coal, charcoal, petroleum coke, wood chips, stoichiometric 2.3-2.8 kg C per kg Si). Reaction: SiO₂ + 2C → Si + 2CO↑ (silicon liquid at 2,000°C, 1,414°C melting point, taps to ladles, cast 10-100 kg blocks). Product: MG-Si 98-99.5% Si (0.5-2% Fe, Al, Ca impurities, commodity for aluminum alloys, silicones). **Upgrade to solar-grade:** Directional solidification (Siemens-like, melt MG-Si in crucible, controlled cooling from bottom, impurities concentrate in melt, discard top, 99.9999% 6N Si for solar cells). **Semiconductor-grade:** Trichlorosilane route (MG-Si + HCl → SiHCl₃ trichlorosilane gas, fractional distillation purify to 99.9999999% 9N, Siemens process deposit on hot rods 1,100°C → polysilicon 9-11N purity, Czochralski pull single-crystal ingots → wafers). Total: 1 tonne polysilicon requires 2-3 tonnes MG-Si, which requires 2.5-3.5 tonnes quartz. Global polysilicon 1 Mt/year (2023, semiconductors 150k tonnes, solar PV 850k tonnes China 85% dominance), consumes 2-3 Mt ultra-high-purity quartz (0.5% of total silica sand market, but 10-100× price premium $500-5,000/tonne quartzite vs common sand $20-80/tonne).

**Step 176-185: Environmental and Health**
**Mining impacts:** Land disturbance (open pits 50-500 hectares, dredge operations offshore 1-5 km², reclamation required, Wisconsin controversy 2010s community opposition frac sand mines, truck traffic, dust, dewatering aquifers). Groundwater (dewatering lowers water table, impacts wells/wetlands within 1-5 km, 1-10 million L/day pumping large mine). **Processing:** Water consumption 2-5 m³/tonne sand (80-95% recycled, clarifiers settle fines, discharge 0.1-0.5 m³/tonne, TSS <50 mg/L treated). Tailings (clay, silt, out-of-spec, 5-20% of feed tonnage, settling ponds 5-50 hectares per facility, dry stack or subaqueous disposal). **Silicosis hazard:** Respirable crystalline silica (RCS, particles <10 µm aerodynamic diameter, penetrate deep lungs, chronic inhalation scars alveoli, silicosis develops 10-30 years exposure, no cure, increases TB risk, OSHA PEL 50 µg/m³, NIOSH REL 25 µg/m³). High-risk operations: dry processing (screening, bagging, loading without dust suppression), abrasive blasting (sandblasting 1,000-10,000 µg/m³ without controls, respirators + wet methods + substitute abrasives mandatory). Controls: wet methods (suppress dust at source), enclosed conveyors, baghouse filtration on dryers/screens (99.9% removal), PPE (N95 respirators minimum, supplied-air for high-exposure). Medical surveillance: chest X-rays, spirometry, worker training. **Transport:** Truck traffic (community impacts, 20-50 trucks/hour large mine, road wear, dust, noise, rail preferred for long-haul >300 km). Railcar dust (cover loads, spray water, reduce fugitive emissions at transload). **Reclamation:** Restore topography, topsoil, native vegetation, convert to agriculture/forestry/recreation (Wisconsin examples: pit lakes fishing/swimming, prairie restoration, solar farms on reclaimed land). Timeline: 3-10 years, cost $5,000-30,000/hectare, bonding required $10,000-100,000/hectare upfront.

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Outlook**
Global industrial silica sand: 300 Mt/year (2023, excludes common construction sand). USA 120 Mt (40%, frac sand 90 Mt + glass/foundry 30 Mt, Wisconsin, Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Michigan), China 45 Mt (15%, domestic glass/foundry + construction), Turkey 15 Mt (5%, exports to EU/Middle East), Belgium, Germany, Netherlands combined 15 Mt (5%), others 105 Mt (35%, Egypt, Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa). **Pricing:** Frac sand $35-180/tonne (volatile with oil/drilling activity, 2024 $40-70/tonne Wisconsin FOB, Texas in-basin $30-50/tonne, unit train freight adds $15-40/tonne, spot $50-120/tonne wellsite delivered). Glass sand $30-100/tonne (premium low-iron <0.02% Fe $60-120/tonne, standard 0.03-0.05% Fe $30-60/tonne, ex-plant or FOB mine). Foundry sand $20-60/tonne (rounded Ottawa benchmark $50-80/tonne, lower-quality angular $20-40/tonne). Ultra-high-purity quartz (electronics) $500-5,000/tonne (hand-sorted lump quartz, <50 ppm impurities, niche market 50-100k tpy globally). **Cost structure:** Mining $5-15/tonne (dredging or open pit, labor, fuel, equipment amortization). Processing $10-30/tonne (washing, classification, drying, energy $5-10/tonne, water treatment $2-5/tonne, labor/overhead $5-10/tonne). Transport $5-60/tonne (local truck <50 km $5-15/tonne, rail 500-2,000 km $15-40/tonne, barge $5-20/tonne if waterway access). Total delivered: $30-120/tonne depending on distance, specs. **Outlook:** Frac sand demand volatile (tied to oil $60-100/bbl supports 10,000-15,000 US wells/year, 100-120 Mt sand, but long-term decline 2030-2050 as oil production peaks, electrification reduces demand). Glass sand stable (1-2% growth, construction, packaging, solar panel cover glass 20-30 Mt/year by 2030, offsets container glass decline). Foundry sand declining (China dominance metal casting, lightweighting aluminum vs iron, 3D printing sand molds reduces waste but total tonnage declines). Silicon metal/polysilicon growing (solar PV expansion 1-2 Mt polysilicon by 2030, requires 3-4 Mt quartz, $3-6B market high-purity quartz, Norway, Brazil, USA supply oligopoly).

Price: $0.04/kg ($40/tonne) represents bulk frac sand or standard-grade glass sand at mine gate. Range $20-5,000/tonne depending on purity and application (common sand $20-40, glass sand $30-100, frac sand $35-180 cyclical, foundry $20-60, electronics-grade quartz $500-5,000). Used in: glass (windows, bottles, fiberglass, 70-75% SiO₂ in final glass product), hydraulic fracturing (proppant holds shale fractures open, 2-10k tonnes per well), foundry casting molds (iron, steel, aluminum), construction (concrete aggregate, mortar, less pure), ceramics, filtration, silicon metal production (polysilicon for semiconductors, solar panels). Per tonne glass: 0.6-0.75 tonnes silica sand → $18-75 raw material depending on grade/purity.
