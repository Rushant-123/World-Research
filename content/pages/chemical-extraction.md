1. Feed preparation: grinding or dissolution
2. Solvent selection based on selectivity
3. Organic solvents: hexane, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone
4. Aqueous extraction: pH-dependent
5. Mixer-settler extraction
6. Mixing stage: intensive agitation
7. Residence time: 2-10 minutes
8. Phase separation in settling tank
9. Organic and aqueous phases separate by density
10. Settling time: 10-30 minutes
11. Interface level control
12. Extract phase contains desired component
13. Raffinate phase is depleted feed
14. Counter-current extraction for efficiency
15. Multiple stages increase recovery
16. 3-6 stages typical
17. Solvent-to-feed ratio optimized
18. Usually 1:1 to 5:1
19. Column extractors: packed or pulsed
20. Packed column with structured packing
21. Pulsed column with reciprocating flow
22. Centrifugal extractors for fast separation
23. Residence time reduced to seconds
24. High throughput in compact unit
25. Solvent recovery by distillation
26. Distillation column separates solvent from product
27. Solvent recycled to extraction
28. Make-up solvent added for losses
29. Product purification
30. Crystallization or further distillation
31. Solvent losses: 0.1-1% of flow
32. Extraction efficiency: 90-99%
33. Temperature control affects selectivity
34. Cooling or heating as required
35. Materials: stainless steel or glass-lined
36. Corrosion considerations
37. Safety: flammable solvent handling
38. Vapor recovery systems
39. Inert atmosphere (nitrogen blanketing)
40. Fire protection systems
41. Process control automation
42. Online analyzers for composition
43. Density and interface level sensors
44. Flow control of phases
45. Environmental compliance
46. Solvent emission controls
47. Waste minimization strategies
