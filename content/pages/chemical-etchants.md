# How to Make Chemical Etchants

Selective removal of materials during semiconductor processing.

**Oxide Etch:** [HF Acid](hf-acid) (hydrofluoric acid) - only chemical that attacks SiO₂ rapidly. SiO₂ + 6HF → H₂SiF₆ + 2H₂O. Extremely dangerous - causes deep tissue burns. Diluted to 1-49% depending on application. Buffered HF (BHF): HF + NH₄F for controlled etch rate.

**Silicon Etch:** Mixture of [HNO₃](nitric-acid) + [HF](hf-acid) + [Acetic Acid]. Anisotropic etch: KOH etches <111> planes slowly, creates V-grooves for MEMS.

**Metal Etch:** [H₂SO₄](sulfuric-acid) + [H₂O₂](h2o2-solution) etches copper. [H₃PO₄](phosphoric-acid) at 180°C etches aluminum.

**Cleaning:** RCA Clean - [NH₄OH](nh4oh-solution) + H₂O₂ (removes organics), then HCl + H₂O₂ (removes metals). SC-1 and SC-2 solutions. Piranha: H₂SO₄ + H₂O₂ (removes organic residues). Price: $50-500/liter depending on purity. Semiconductor-grade: metals <1 ppb.
