Noble metal - chemically inert, excellent conductor, does not oxidize. Electronics: wire bonding (chip-to-package), connectors, contacts, electroplating (PCB fingers). Jewelry: 50% of demand. Investment: 30% (bars, coins, ETFs). Industrial: 8% (electronics 7%, dental 1%). Annual production: 3,000 tonnes (mine) + 1,300 tonnes (recycled) = 4,300 tonnes total supply.

**Step 1-15: [Gold Ore](gold-mining) Geology and Mining**
Gold occurrence: native gold (metallic Au, 80-99% purity with silver impurity), gold in sulfides (arsenopyrite FeAsS, pyrite FeS₂, 1-100 ppm Au disseminated), tellurides (calaverite AuTe₂, sylvanite AgAuTe₄, high-grade 20-60% Au, rare). Ore grades: high-grade underground 5-20 g/t Au (5-20 ppm), open pit 0.5-3 g/t, placer (alluvial) 0.1-1 g/t. Deposits: orogenic (structurally controlled in metamorphic belts, Abitibi Canada, Western Australia), Carlin-type (disseminated in calcareous sediments, Nevada), epithermal (volcanic-hosted, high sulfidation), porphyry copper-gold (byproduct, low grade 0.3-0.8 g/t Au), placer (eroded from primary deposits, concentrated in streams). Mining: underground (narrow veins, high-grade, cut-and-fill or longhole stoping), open pit (large tonnage, low grade, 10,000-200,000 t/day), placer (dredging, sluicing).

**Step 16-32: Crushing, Grinding, and Gravity Concentration**
Crush ore: jaw crusher 1,000mm → 150mm, cone crusher 150mm → 10-25mm. Grind in ball mill or SAG mill to 75-150 µm (80% passing, liberation size). Gravity concentration (if coarse free gold present): jigs, shaking tables, or centrifugal concentrators (Falcon, Knelson). Gold density 19.3 g/cm³ vs gangue 2.7 g/cm³ (7× heavier, gravity methods very effective). Recover 30-70% of gold as gravity concentrate (1-10 kg concentrate per tonne ore, 5-40% Au). Smelting gravity concentrate: flux with borax, smelt in furnace at 1,100°C, gold melts (mp 1,064°C) and coalesces, slag floats. Cast into doré bars (80-95% Au+Ag). Remainder of gold (fine disseminated) in tailings → cyanide leaching.

**Step 33-52: [Cyanide Leaching](heap-leach) - Heap Leach or CIL**
Gold dissolves in dilute cyanide solution: 4Au + 8CN⁻ + O₂ + 2H₂O → 4Au(CN)₂⁻ + 4OH⁻ (Elsner equation, 1846). Requires oxygen (aeration). Cyanide forms stable complex with gold. **Heap leaching:** low-grade ore (0.3-1.5 g/t Au), no grinding. Crush to 10-50mm, agglomerate with lime and water (forms pellets, prevents clay sealing), stack on impermeable lined pad (HDPE liner, 1-2mm thick). Heap height: 5-20 meters. Apply cyanide solution (0.02-0.05% NaCN, pH 10-11 with lime) via drip irrigation (1-30 L/m²/hour). Solution percolates through heap, dissolves gold over 30-180 days. Collect pregnant solution (Au-bearing, 0.5-5 ppm Au) at pad bottom, pump to recovery. **CIL (carbon-in-leach):** higher-grade ore (>1.5 g/t), fine grind (<150 µm). Slurry (ore + water, 40-50% solids) in agitated tanks with cyanide (0.02-0.1% NaCN) and activated carbon granules (1-4mm coconut shell carbon). Residence time: 24-48 hours. Gold dissolves, adsorbs onto carbon simultaneously. Separate carbon by screens, ore tailings to waste.

**Step 53-70: Gold Recovery from [Carbon](cil-process)**
Carbon loaded with gold: 3,000-10,000 g Au/tonne carbon (vs solution 0.5-5 ppm). **Elution:** strip gold from carbon. Heat carbon + NaOH (1%) + NaCN (0.2%) solution to 90-120°C in elution column, pressure 2-3 bar. Gold desorbs into solution (barren solution → pregnant eluate, 100-500 ppm Au). **Electrowinning:** plate gold from eluate. [Electrolytic cells](electrolytic-recovery): stainless steel cathodes, mild steel anodes, pregnant eluate electrolyte. Apply DC current 100-300 A/m². Au(CN)₂⁻ + e⁻ → Au + 2CN⁻ (gold plates on cathode as spongy deposit). 24-48 hours, recover 95-99% of gold. Remove cathodes, scrape gold sludge (gold mud, 40-70% Au, 10-20% Ag, remainder Cu, Fe, Zn). **Regenerate carbon:** acid wash (HCl removes carbonates), heat to 650-700°C in rotary kiln (reactivates carbon, burns organics, restores adsorption capacity). Recycle to CIL tanks. Carbon loss: 5-10% per cycle (attrition, burning), make up with fresh carbon.

**Step 71-88: Refining - Smelting and Fire Assay**
Gold sludge from electrowinning: impure (40-70% Au). [Smelting](gold-smelter): flux with borax (Na₂B₄O₇, 20-40% of charge), soda ash (Na₂CO₃), silica (SiO₂). Melt in furnace (gas, electric, or induction) at 1,100-1,300°C. Gold and silver alloy, form liquid button (sink to bottom, density 15-19 g/cm³ depending on Ag content). Base metals oxidize: Cu → CuO, Fe → FeO, Zn → ZnO. Flux forms slag (silicate glass, absorbs metal oxides, floats on button). Pour into mold, cool. Doré bar: 80-95% Au, 5-20% Ag, <1% Cu+Fe+Zn. Weight: 10-30 kg typical. Stamp with assay, weight, serial number. Fire assay: test doré composition. Cupellation (oxidize Pb in bone ash cupel at 900-1,000°C, PbO absorbs in cupel, Au+Ag bead remains, weigh). Inquartation (alloy with Ag to 25-35% Au, dissolve Ag in nitric acid, Au remains, calculate Au%). ICP-MS for trace elements.

**Step 89-108: Electrolytic Refining - 99.99% Gold**
Refine doré to 99.99% (four-nines) or 99.999% (five-nines) purity. Electrolytic method (Wohlwill process): electrolyte is gold chloride (AuCl₃ in HCl, 60-80 g/L Au, 10% free HCl), temperature 60-70°C. Anodes: cast doré bars (80-95% Au), 5-10 kg each. Cathodes: thin pure gold starter sheets (0.5mm) or titanium plates. Suspend 10-20 anodes and cathodes alternately in cell, spacing 20-30mm. Apply DC current: 200-400 A/m², voltage 1.5-2.0 V per cell. At anode: Au → Au³⁺ + 3e⁻ (gold dissolves). Ag doesn't dissolve (AgCl forms, passivates anode, falls as slime). Platinum group metals (Pt, Pd if present) dissolve but don't plate. At cathode: Au³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Au (gold plates as crystalline deposit). Current efficiency: 95-98%. Time: 24-48 hours, plate 2-3 kg gold per cathode. Remove cathodes, rinse, melt plated gold in graphite crucible at 1,100°C. Cast into bars, molds, or granules. Purity: 99.99-99.999% Au (electronically tested, ICP-MS verifies <10 ppm total impurities). London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) Good Delivery gold: ≥99.5% Au min, 350-430 troy oz bars (11-13 kg).

**Step 109-125: Product Forms for Electronics**
**Bonding wire:** Draw gold into wire (see gold wire page for details). Diameter 15-50 µm (0.6-2 mil). Purity: 99.99% (4N) for standard, 99.999% (5N) for high-reliability. **Electroplating solutions:** Dissolve gold in aqua regia (3:1 HCl:HNO₃): Au + HNO₃ + 4HCl → HAuCl₄ + NO + 2H₂O (chloroauric acid). Dilute, adjust pH. Electroplating baths: potassium gold cyanide (KAu(CN)₂, cyanide bath, 1-10 g/L Au, plate at 0.5-2 A/dm², 50-60°C), or sulfite baths (non-cyanide, environmental). Plate gold onto PCB edge connectors (0.5-2 µm thickness, 1.5-8 mg/dm²), semiconductor leadframes (0.05-0.3 µm flash over nickel underplate), or integrated circuit bond pads (0.2-0.5 µm). **Sputtering targets:** 99.99-99.999% gold discs, 100-300mm diameter, 3-10mm thick, 1-5 kg. Bonded to copper backing plate (thermal conductivity). Used in vacuum deposition (sputter Au onto wafer for metallization layers, bonding pads). **Gold salts:** HAuCl₄ (chloroauric acid, electroplating), Au(CN)⁻ (gold cyanide, plating), gold colloids (nanoparticles 1-100 nm, catalysts, diagnostics).

**Step 126-140: Electronics Applications and Consumption**
**Wire bonding:** 1.5 µm diameter wire, 2-6mm length per bond, ~0.03 mg per bond. High-pin-count chip (500 bonds) → 15 mg gold (~$1 at $65,000/kg). Alternative: copper wire (cost savings). **Electroplating:** PCB edge connectors (RAM, video cards) plate 1-5 µm Au over 1-3 µm Ni. Hard gold (99.0% Au, 0.5% Co or Ni hardener) for wear resistance (insertion cycles). Total: 0.05-0.2 g per connector. Smartphone (micro-USB, SIM slot, internal connectors) → 0.03-0.08 g gold. **Bonding pads:** semiconductor die has 50-500 bond pads, each 75-100 µm square, 0.5 µm Au thickness → 0.001-0.02 mg per pad, 0.05-10 mg per die depending on size and pad count. **Total electronics consumption:** 250-280 tonnes Au/year (2023, ~8% of total gold demand). Breakdown: bonding wire 150 tonnes, electroplating 80 tonnes, other 20 tonnes. Recycling: e-waste contains 200-800 ppm Au (vs 0.5-5 ppm in ore, 100-1000× richer). PCBs: 100-250 ppm Au. Recycling efficiency: 95-98% recovery from scrap (smelting, leaching, electrorefining).

**Step 141-155: Market, Price, and Economics**
Gold price: $1,200-2,100/troy oz over 2010-2024, average $1,600/oz ($51,000/kg). Price drivers: investment demand (safe haven, inflation hedge), jewelry demand (India, China culturally significant), central bank buying (reserve diversification), mining supply (inelastic short-term), recycling supply (elastic, increases when price high), USD strength (inverse correlation). Production cost: all-in sustaining cost (AISC) $900-1,300/oz for 90th percentile of mines (2023). Lowest-cost mines (Barrick Goldstrike, Newmont Carlin): $600-900/oz. High-cost underground: $1,200-1,600/oz. Reserves: 57,000 tonnes (USGS). R/P ratio: 19 years (but exploration replenishes, reserve life stable 15-20 years for decades). Top producers: China 370 tonnes/year (12%), Russia 330 tonnes (11%), Australia 310 tonnes (10%), USA 170 tonnes, Canada 170 tonnes, Peru 150 tonnes, Ghana 140 tonnes, Mexico 130 tonnes, Brazil 110 tonnes, Indonesia 100 tonnes. Byproduct gold: 25-30% of production from copper, lead-zinc, nickel mines (credited against base metal costs, low marginal cost).

Price: $0.15/kg ($150/tonne, normalized for supply chain model). Actual gold: $50,000-65,000/kg ($1,500-2,000/troy oz). Per bond wire allocation: 0.03 mg Au × $60,000/kg = $0.0018 per bond. Chip with 200 bonds → $0.36 gold content. PCB connector: 0.1 g Au × $60/g = $6 gold content (high-value component). The $0.15 represents simplified supply chain abstraction for input cost modeling, not spot gold price. In reality, gold cost per chip ranges $0.01-2.00 depending on package type (QFN vs BGA), bond count, and wire material (gold vs copper). Gold is highest-value material per kg in electronics (1,000× more expensive than copper, 200,000× more than silicon), but used in mg quantities (total value moderate).
