# How to Make a Data Center

Facility housing servers and networking equipment. Provides: redundant power, cooling, physical security, network connectivity. Hyperscale data centers (AWS, Google, Microsoft) contain hundreds of thousands of servers. Colocation data centers rent space/power to customers.

## What is it?

[Building Structure](industrial-building) with: [Server Racks](server-rack) holding thousands of [Servers](rack-servers), [Networking Equipment](network-switches) connecting them, [Cooling Systems](hvac-cooling) removing 100-1000+ kW of heat, [UPS Systems](ups-systems) and [Backup Generators](backup-generators) for 99.99%+ uptime, [Fire Suppression](fire-suppression) (clean agent, not water), [Security](security-infrastructure) (biometrics, cameras, guards).

**Tiers:** Tier 1 (99.67% uptime), Tier 2 (99.75%), Tier 3 (99.98%), Tier 4 (99.99%). Higher tier = more redundancy. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE): 1.1-1.5 (1.0 = perfect, all power to IT equipment).

Hyperscale DC: 50,000+ servers, 20-50 MW power, $500M-1B construction cost, 2-3 years to build.
