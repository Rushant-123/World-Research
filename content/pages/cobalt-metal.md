# How to Make Cobalt Metal

**Top Market Leaders:**

- [China Molybdenum](/companies/china-molybdenum)
- [Sherritt](/companies/sherritt)



Strategic metal - critical for lithium-ion batteries (cathode stabilizer), superalloys (jet engines, gas turbines), hard materials (carbide cutting tools), catalysts. Global production: 190,000 tonnes (2023). DRC Congo: 70% of supply (world's largest copper-cobalt deposits, artisanal mining concerns, child labor controversies, supply chain scrutiny).

**Step 1-20: [Geology and Ore Types](copper-cobalt-ore)**
Cobalt rarely forms own ore body - occurs as byproduct. **Copper-cobalt deposits (60% of supply):** Central African Copperbelt (DRC Congo, Zambia), sediment-hosted stratiform mineralization. Minerals: heterogenite Co³⁺O(OH) (45-58% Co, oxidized zone), carrollite CuCo₂S₄ (38% Co, sulfide zone), cobaltpentlandite (Co,Ni,Fe)₉S₈. Copper-cobalt ratio: 20:1 to 100:1 (mine primarily for copper, cobalt as valuable credit). Ore grades: 0.1-1% Co in sulfide ore, 0.3-3% Co in oxide ore. **Nickel-cobalt laterites (30%):** Tropical weathering deposits (New Caledonia, Philippines, Indonesia, Cuba). Limonite zone: Fe-Ni-Co oxyhydroxides, 0.05-0.3% Co (low but large tonnage). **Nickel sulfide deposits (8%):** Sudbury Canada, Norilsk Russia, magmatic sulfides (pentlandite (Ni,Fe)₉S₈ + pyrrhotite Fe₁₋ₓS + chalcopyrite CuFeS₂), 0.01-0.1% Co trace. **Arsenic ores (2%):** Morocco (cobaltite CoAsS, 35% Co), arsenide ores, roast to remove arsenic (toxic emissions, declining). **DRC production:** 140,000 tonnes Co (2023, 73% of world). Katanga province: Tenke Fungurume (China Molybdenum CMOC, 18,000 tpy Co), Mutanda (Glencore, 27,000 tpy restarted 2021), Kamoto (Glencore, 12,000 tpy), Ruashi, Luiswishi. Artisanal mining (creuseurs): 15-20% of DRC output, hand-dug shafts 10-50m, no safety equipment, sell to middlemen, child labor (40,000-80,000 children estimate UNICEF 2014-2020, initiatives to formalize supply chains, certification schemes - Fair Cobalt Alliance, Responsible Minerals Initiative).

**Step 21-45: Mining and Concentration - Oxide Ores (DRC)**
Open pit mining: drill-blast-haul (similar to copper). Stripping ratio: 3-8:1 (waste:ore). Ore grade: 0.3-1.5% Co, 2-5% Cu. Crush: jaw crusher (1,000mm → 100mm), cone crusher (100mm → 10mm). Grind: ball mill or SAG mill to 80% passing 75 µm. **Gravity separation:** Heavy media separator (magnetite suspension, density 2.8-3.2 g/cm³), ore sinks (heterogenite, malachite), gangue floats (quartz, clays). Concentrate: 2-5% Co, 10-20% Cu, 20-30% Fe. **Flotation (for sulfide ores):** Xanthate collectors (potassium ethyl xanthate 50-200 g/tonne), frothers (MIBC 20-50 g/tonne), pH 8-10 (lime). Copper sulfides (chalcopyrite, bornite) float with cobalt sulfides (carrollite). Bulk concentrate: 1-3% Co, 15-30% Cu. Tailings: 0.05-0.2% Co, 0.3-0.8% Cu (losses). Recovery: 75-90% Co to concentrate. **Challenges:** DRC infrastructure (limited electricity, rail export via Dar es Salaam Tanzania or Durban South Africa, 2,000+ km haul), political instability, corruption, permitting delays, environmental regulations weak enforcement, water scarcity (Katanga plateau 1,200-1,500m elevation, semi-arid).

**Step 46-72: [Hydrometallurgical Processing](acid-leach) - Leaching**
Oxide concentrate (heterogenite, malachite) leaches easily in acid. Sulfide concentrate requires roasting first (convert to oxides, remove sulfur). **Sulfuric acid leaching:** Mix concentrate with [sulfuric acid](sulfuric-acid) (H₂SO₄, 50-200 g/L free acid, 1.5-2.5:1 acid:ore ratio). Agitated tanks (mechanical stirring or air agitation), 60-95°C, atmospheric pressure or slight pressure (2-4 bar autoclave for faster kinetics), 4-12 hours residence. Reactions: Co³⁺O(OH) + H₂SO₄ + H₂SO₃ (reducing agent) → CoSO₄ + H₂O (heterogenite dissolves, Co³⁺ reduces to Co²⁺ in solution). CuCO₃·Cu(OH)₂ + 2H₂SO₄ → 2CuSO₄ + CO₂ + 3H₂O (malachite). Iron: Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3H₂O (dissolves as ferric sulfate). **Reductive leaching:** Add reducing agent (sulfur dioxide SO₂ gas, sodium metabisulfite Na₂S₂O₅, or scrubbed smelter off-gas) to convert Co³⁺ → Co²⁺ (more stable, higher solubility). Pregnant leach solution (PLS): 2-10 g/L Co, 10-40 g/L Cu, 5-20 g/L Fe, 1-5 g/L Mn, 0.5-3 g/L Mg, pH 1.5-3.5. **Solid-liquid separation:** Thickeners (gravity settling, 50-100m diameter, flocculants polyacrylamide 20-50 g/tonne solids). Underflow (leach residue, 40-60% solids) to tails dam. Overflow (clarified PLS) to purification. Residue contains: unleached silicates, Fe-Mn oxides (partially soluble), gypsum CaSO₄·2H₂O (if neutralization with lime).

**Step 73-100: Purification and [Solvent Extraction](sx-cobalt) Separation**
PLS contains Co + Cu + Fe + Mn + Zn + Ni (all dissolved in sulfate solution, similar chemistry, must separate). **Copper removal:** Cementation with cobalt metal powder or scrap. Cu²⁺ + Co⁰ → Cu⁰ + Co²⁺ (copper plates out as metallic cement, cobalt returns to solution). Copper cement: 70-90% Cu, washed, smelted. Alternatively: solvent extraction with LIX 984N or similar (copper-selective extractant, pH 1.5-2.5), strip with H₂SO₄, electrowin Cu. **Iron precipitation:** Oxidize Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ with air or H₂O₂, raise pH to 3-4 with lime or limestone. Fe(OH)₃ precipitates (ferric hydroxide, jarosite if sulfate present). Mn, Mg stay in solution (precipitate pH >8). Filter iron sludge. **Cobalt solvent extraction (Cyanex 272 or D2EHPA):** Organic phase: 20-40% Cyanex 272 (organophosphinic acid) or D2EHPA in kerosene/Isopar diluent + TBP modifier (prevents third-phase formation). Aqueous feed: purified solution 3-8 g/L Co, pH 5-6 (adjusted with limestone, lime, or MgO). Mixer-settlers: 3-6 extraction stages (Co²⁺ extracts into organic, leaves Mn²⁺, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Zn²⁺ in raffinate). Scrub: 2-3 stages with dilute acid (remove co-extracted Mn, Zn). Strip: 3-5 stages with concentrated H₂SO₄ (150-200 g/L) at 40-50°C (reverse extraction, Co²⁺ back into aqueous as concentrated cobalt sulfate, 30-60 g/L Co). Organic recycle to extraction. **Product:** Cobalt sulfate solution, 30-60 g/L Co (as CoSO₄·7H₂O equivalent), >99% Co (impurities: Ni <500 ppm, Mn <200 ppm, Fe <50 ppm, Cu <20 ppm, Zn <50 ppm).

**Step 101-125: Cobalt Metal Production - [Electrowinning](electrolytic-cobalt)**
[Electrolytic deposition](electrolytic-cobalt) from cobalt sulfate solution. **Cell design:** Concrete tank lined with PVC or PP, 2m × 4m × 1.5m deep. Electrolyte: CoSO₄ solution (30-60 g/L Co) + H₂SO₄ (50-100 g/L free acid, improve conductivity), temperature 55-65°C (heating by waste heat or electric heaters). Anodes: lead-silver alloy (Pb-1% Ag, inert, withstands oxygen evolution, 50-100 anodes per cell). Cathodes: stainless steel (316L) starter sheets or titanium plates (30-50 cathodes per cell). Spacing: 60-100mm anode-cathode distance. **Electrodeposition:** Apply DC current, 200-350 A/m² cathode current density, 2.5-3.5V per cell (IR drop + overpotentials). Anode reaction: H₂O → ½O₂ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxygen evolution). Cathode reaction: Co²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Co⁰ (cobalt plates as metallic deposit). Current efficiency: 88-95% (side reaction: hydrogen evolution 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂, especially at high current density). Deposition rate: 1-2 mm/day. Cycle time: 5-10 days, plate 10-15 kg Co per cathode. **Cathode stripping:** Remove cathodes from cell, rinse with water, strip cobalt deposit from starter sheet (peel off or mechanically separate). Cobalt cathode: 99.3-99.8% Co (impurities: Ni 0.05-0.2%, Fe 0.02-0.1%, Cu 0.01-0.05%, S 0.01-0.05%), brittle crystalline structure (dendritic growth), break into pieces for melting or sell as cathode.

**Step 126-145: Alternative - Hydrogen Reduction of Cobalt Oxide**
Produce cobalt metal powder or briquettes from cobalt oxide. **Precipitation:** Add lime, caustic, or carbonate to cobalt sulfate solution. Co²⁺ + 2OH⁻ → Co(OH)₂ ↓ (cobalt hydroxide, pink precipitate). Or: Co²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CoCO₃ ↓ (cobalt carbonate, pink-violet). Filter, wash (remove sulfate, impurities). Dry at 100-150°C. **Thermal decomposition:** Heat to 200-400°C in air. Co(OH)₂ → CoO + H₂O (cobalt oxide, black). CoCO₃ → CoO + CO₂. **Hydrogen reduction:** Feed CoO powder to reduction furnace (pusher furnace, rotary kiln, or fluidized bed). Atmosphere: pure H₂ or H₂-N₂ mix (10-100% H₂, higher = faster reduction). Temperature: 600-900°C. Reaction: CoO + H₂ → Co + H₂O (reduction to metal, exothermic). Residence time: 2-6 hours. Product: cobalt powder, 95-99.5% Co (residual oxygen 0.5-3%, impurities from feed). Powder properties: particle size 1-10 µm (fine), surface area 0.5-2 m²/g, magnetic (ferromagnetic, Curie temperature 1,115°C), pyrophoric if very fine (handle in inert atmosphere, passivate with controlled oxidation 0.2-0.5% surface oxide, stabilizes). **Briquetting:** Compress powder into briquettes (50-100 mm diameter, 10-50 mm thick, 0.5-2 kg each), hydraulic press (200-500 MPa), binder optional (Ni powder 1-5% improves cohesion). Sinter at 900-1,200°C in H₂ (densify, remove porosity, strength improves). Density: 7-8.5 g/cm³ (vs bulk powder 1-3 g/cm³).

**Step 146-165: Refining to High Purity**
Battery-grade cobalt metal or cobalt sulfate: stringent specs (<50 ppm each: Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Cr, Al; <10 ppm Pb, Cd, As). **Electrorefining:** Cast electrowon cobalt into anodes (melt at 1,500-1,600°C in induction furnace under Ar, cast 20-50 kg bars). Electrolytic cell: CoSO₄-H₂SO₄ electrolyte (similar to electrowinning but higher purity reagents). Anodes: impure cobalt metal. Cathodes: pure cobalt starter sheets or titanium. Current density: 150-250 A/m², 50-60°C, 7-14 days per cycle. Anode dissolves: Co → Co²⁺ + 2e⁻. Impurities (Ni, Fe, Cu) dissolve or fall as anode slime (sludge, contains Cu, Ni if present). Cathode plates pure Co: Co²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Co. Purity: 99.9-99.99% (3N-4N). **Zone refining:** Pass induction coil along cobalt rod (floating zone technique), impurities concentrate in melt zone, move to rod end. Multiple passes: 50-100 passes achieve 99.999% (5N) for ultra-high purity (electronics, aerospace alloys). **Vacuum melting:** Melt refined cobalt in vacuum induction furnace (10⁻² to 10⁻⁴ mbar, 1,600°C), degas (remove H, N, O), cast into ingots (10-100 kg). Argon back-fill before solidification (prevent pickup). Product: cobalt metal ingots, 99.9-99.99% Co, dense (8.9 g/cm³), tough, corrosion-resistant, high-temperature strength.

**Step 166-180: Cobalt Chemicals for Batteries**
**Cobalt sulfate heptahydrate (CoSO₄·7H₂O):** Crystallize from purified cobalt sulfate solution. Evaporate to saturation (35-45°C, solubility 36 g CoSO₄/100 mL at 20°C), seed with CoSO₄ crystals, cool to 10-20°C over 12-48 hours (crystallization). Filter, centrifuge (remove mother liquor). Wash with cold water (minimal, reduces yield). Dry at 40-60°C (avoid dehydration >70°C, loses water of crystallization). Product: pink/red crystals, monoclinic structure, 99.5-99.95% CoSO₄·7H₂O (21% Co content). Battery-grade: <50 ppm Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Mg, Ca each. **Cobalt oxide (Co₃O₄):** Calcine cobalt hydroxide or carbonate in air, 400-900°C (spinel structure, black powder). Particle size: 0.5-5 µm. Surface area: 5-30 m²/g. Used in: battery precursors (NMC, NCA cathode synthesis), catalysts, pigments (cobalt blue glass/ceramics). **Cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)₂):** Precipitate from sulfate with NaOH, filter, dry (β-form, pink, hexagonal). Purity: 99.5% Co(OH)₂ (61% Co content). **Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO₂):** Mix Li₂CO₃ + Co₃O₄ (stoichiometric ratio), calcine at 800-1,000°C in oxygen. Layered structure (R3̄m space group), purple-black powder. First Li-ion cathode (1991 Sony), specific capacity 140-150 mAh/g, voltage 3.7V vs Li/Li⁺. Now <10% of batteries (consumer electronics small cells), replaced by NMC (Ni-Mn-Co) for EVs (higher energy density, lower Co content 10-20% vs 60% in LCO).

**Step 181-195: Market, Pricing, and Supply Chain Ethics**
Global cobalt production: 190,000 tonnes (2023). DRC: 140,000 t (74%), Indonesia: 12,000 t (laterite mines ramping), Russia: 6,000 t, Philippines: 4,500 t, Cuba: 4,000 t, Canada: 3,500 t, Australia: 3,000 t, others: 17,000 t. Demand: batteries 71% (135,000 t), superalloys 11%, hard materials/carbides 8%, catalysts 6%, magnets, pigments, other 4%. **Battery types:** LCO (lithium cobalt oxide): 10% (consumer electronics). NMC (Ni-Mn-Co oxide): 55% (NCM811, NCM622, NCM532 - numbers indicate Ni:Mn:Co ratios, EV industry trend to high-Ni 8:1:1 or 9:0.5:0.5 to reduce Co). NCA (Ni-Co-Al oxide): 10% (Tesla Model S/X, high Ni 80-85%, Co 10-15%). LFP (lithium iron phosphate): 25% (Co-free, Chinese EVs, stationary storage). Future: Co content per kWh declining (NCM811 12 kg Co/100 kWh vs NCM622 20 kg/100 kWh vs LCO 60 kg/100 kWh). But total EVs growing (IEA projects 30 million EV sales/year by 2030 vs 10 million 2023, net cobalt demand still rising 2-3× to 300,000 tonnes by 2030). **Pricing:** $25,000-95,000/tonne (2010-2024 range). 2018 peak: $95,000/t (EV hype, supply fears). 2020 crash: $25,000/t (pandemic, oversupply). 2023: $30,000-35,000/t. Volatility driven by: DRC supply disruptions (political instability, export taxes, artisanal mine closures), battery demand elasticity, inventory cycles (China stockpiles 20,000-40,000 t strategic reserve). **Ethics:** Child labor (UNICEF 2016 report, Amnesty International investigations, Apple, Samsung, Tesla supply chain scrutiny). Initiatives: Responsible Cobalt Initiative (RCI), Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA), OECD Due Diligence Guidance, EU Battery Regulation (2024, mandatory supply chain due diligence, <65 kg Co₂/kg Co max carbon footprint). Traceability: blockchain pilots (IBM-Ford, RCS Global), mine-to-battery tracking. Formalization: DRC Entreprise Générale du Cobalt (EGC) state buying agency (standardize artisanal purchases, fair prices, eliminate middlemen), but implementation challenges.

Price: $15/kg ($15,000/tonne) represents lower-end cobalt metal price. Actual market: $25,000-95,000/tonne depending on cycle, form (metal vs sulfate), purity. Used in: Li-ion battery cathodes (LCO, NMC, NCA - stabilizes layered structure, prevents oxygen loss, improves safety), superalloys (jet engines, gas turbines - Rene alloys, Haynes alloys 10-20% Co for creep resistance at 700-1,100°C), cemented carbides (WC-Co cutting tools, 5-15% Co binder), catalysts (hydrodesulfurization in refining, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis), magnets (Sm-Co, AlNiCo high-temp magnets). Per smartphone battery: 5-10g Co (0.5g LCO in 3,000 mAh cell @ 60% Co content) → $0.15-0.50. EV battery (60 kWh NCM811, 12 kg Co): $300-1,200 depending on cobalt price.
