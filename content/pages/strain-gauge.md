Strain gauge sensors are precision resistive devices that measure mechanical strain through changes in electrical resistance. When bonded to a structure, the gauge's resistance changes proportionally to the applied strain, enabling force, pressure, torque, and displacement measurements. Modern foil strain gauges achieve gauge factors of 2.0-2.1, meaning a 0.1% strain produces a 0.2% resistance change. These sensors are critical components in force-sensing trackpads, load cells, pressure transducers, and structural health monitoring systems.
