# How to Make Hugo Static Site Generator

Hugo is an open-source static site generator written in Go. Converts markdown files and templates into HTML websites. Extremely fast (builds 1000+ pages in seconds). Free and open source under Apache 2.0 license.

## What is it?

Command-line tool that reads content files (Markdown), applies templates (HTML), and generates static HTML website. No server-side processing needed - just HTML/CSS/JS files. Popular for blogs, documentation, and project sites. Single binary, no dependencies. Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## How It's Made:
1. Written in [Go Programming Language](go-language) by Steve Francia and contributors
2. Source code hosted on [GitHub Repository](github-repository)
3. [Open Source Contributors](open-source-contributors) submit features and bug fixes
4. Core maintainers review and merge pull requests
5. Automated testing with CI/CD
6. Release process: compile Go code for each platform
7. Distribute binaries via GitHub releases and package managers (Homebrew, apt, etc.)
8. Free to use - no license cost

**Features:** Markdown support, themeable, live reload during development, multilingual, taxonomies, shortcodes, asset pipeline, image processing.
