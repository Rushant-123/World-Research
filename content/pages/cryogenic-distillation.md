1. Air separation is primary application
2. Air compressed to 5-10 bar
3. Pre-cooling with chilled water
4. Purification removes CO2 and moisture
5. Molecular sieve adsorbers
6. Switchable beds for regeneration
7. Main heat exchanger cools air to -170°C
8. Turbo-expander further cools and provides refrigeration
9. Air enters lower distillation column
10. Lower column operates at 5-6 bar
11. Nitrogen (BP -196°C) exits top
12. Oxygen-enriched liquid (30-40% O2) at bottom
13. Upper column operates at 1.3 bar
14. Feed from lower column reboiler
15. Nitrogen product from top (99.99% purity)
16. Oxygen product from bottom (99.5% purity)
17. Argon sidestream at middle (crude argon column)
18. Argon BP -186°C between O2 and N2
19. Reboilers use nitrogen condensation heat
20. Heat integration minimizes energy
21. Product warming in heat exchangers
22. Cold products cool incoming air
23. Liquid nitrogen storage at -196°C
24. Vacuum-insulated tanks
25. Liquid oxygen storage at -183°C
26. Safety: oxygen fire hazards
27. Gaseous products via vaporizers
28. Pressure swing for delivery pressure
29. Purity specifications met
30. Nitrogen: <5 ppm O2
31. Oxygen: <5 ppm N2
32. Production rates: 100-3,000 tons O2 per day
33. Energy consumption: 0.4-0.5 kWh per Nm³ O2
34. Plant availability: >95%
35. Cryogenic pumps for liquid handling
36. Instrumentation: temperature, pressure, flow, composition
37. Distributed control system
38. Automated startup and shutdown sequences
39. Safety relief systems
40. Cold box insulated with perlite powder
41. Vacuum-jacketed piping for cryogenic liquids
42. Maintenance: molecular sieve change every 5 years
43. Heat exchanger inspection every 3-5 years
44. Turbo-expander overhaul every 3 years
45. Continuous monitoring for efficiency
46. Optimization of column reflux ratios
