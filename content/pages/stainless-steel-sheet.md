## Summary

This comprehensive 195-step process transforms stainless steel coil into precision-finished sheets suitable for premium Mac enclosures. The cold rolling process reduces thickness to 0.3-3mm range while maintaining tight tolerances. Bright annealing in hydrogen atmosphere provides the characteristic bright finish and restores material properties. Surface finishing operations achieve the 2B or BA finish required for consumer electronics. Passivation enhances corrosion resistance, while precision slitting prepares the material for downstream stamping and forming operations. Each step is critical to achieving the aesthetic quality and mechanical properties demanded by Apple's Mac product line.
