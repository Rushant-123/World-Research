# How to Make Nitrogen Gas

N₂ produced by fractional distillation of liquid air. Atmosphere is 78% N₂, 21% O₂, 1% Ar. Separate by boiling point differences.

## Cryogenic Air Separation:
1. Compress [Air](atmospheric-air) with [Air Compressor](industrial-compressor) to 5-10 bar
2. Cool compressed air to -196°C in [Air Separation Unit](cryogenic-distillation)
3. Air liquefies
4. Fractional distillation column separates components by boiling point:
   - N₂: -196°C
   - Ar: -186°C
   - O₂: -183°C
5. N₂ boils first, collected as gas or liquid
6. [Purification](gas-purifiers) removes traces of O₂ and moisture
7. Purity: 99.999% (industrial) to 99.9999% (semiconductor-grade)

**Uses:** Semiconductor inert atmosphere, food packaging, tire inflation, cryogenics, ammonia production. Industrial N₂: $0.10-0.50/kg. Liquid N₂: $0.20-0.80/kg.
