- [Air Liquide](/companies/air-liquide)



Industrial workhorse gas - 78% of Earth's atmosphere. Production: 150 million tonnes/year globally (2023). Uses: ammonia synthesis (Haber-Bosch, 75% of production), inert atmosphere (chemical reactors, semiconductor fabs, food packaging, 15%), oil/gas well pressurization (5%), cryogenics (liquid nitrogen, 3%), metal treatment (2%). Three production methods: cryogenic air separation (88%, large-scale, high-purity), pressure swing adsorption PSA (10%, on-site, moderate purity 95-99.999%), membrane separation (2%, small-scale, lower purity 90-99%). Cryogenic process separates atmospheric components by boiling point differences: N₂ (-196°C), Ar (-186°C), O₂ (-183°C).

**Step 1-12: [Atmospheric Air](atmospheric-air) Intake and Filtration**
Air composition: N₂ 78.08%, O₂ 20.95%, Ar 0.93%, CO₂ 0.04%, trace gases (Ne, He, Kr, Xe, CH₄) <0.01%. Feed: unlimited source, free raw material. Intake location: ground-level for on-site plants, elevated (15-30m towers) at chemical complexes to avoid dust, fumes from nearby operations. **Pre-filtration**: Multi-stage to protect downstream equipment. (1) Coarse filter: synthetic fiber panels (G4 grade, removes >10 µm particles - pollen, insects, leaves). (2) Fine filter: bag filters (F7-F9 grade, removes 1-10 µm - dust, soot, pollen). Efficiency: 85-95% @ 1 µm. (3) HEPA filter (optional, high-purity plants): 99.97% @ 0.3 µm, removes fine particulates. Pressure drop: 50-200 Pa per stage (minimize to reduce compression energy). Filter replacement: quarterly to annually (depends on location - urban/industrial sites need more frequent). Flow rate: 100,000-500,000 Nm³/h for world-scale plant (1,500-3,000 tonnes O₂/day equivalent, N₂ co-produced 3.7× by mass). Air density: 1.225 kg/m³ @ 15°C, 1 bar. Mass flow: 35-170 kg/s.

**Step 13-28: Compression and Intercooling**
[Centrifugal air compressor](centrifugal-compressor): Multi-stage axial or centrifugal (3-6 stages typical). Compress from atmospheric (1.013 bar) to 5-10 bar (moderate pressure, balance energy vs liquefaction efficiency). **Stage 1**: Axial inlet guide vanes, centrifugal impeller (1.5-3m diameter, 3,000-10,000 rpm depending on size), air accelerates to 200-400 m/s tip speed, kinetic energy converts to pressure in diffuser. Temperature rise: adiabatic compression, T₂ = T₁ × (P₂/P₁)^((γ-1)/γ), γ=1.4 for air. 1→3 bar: 20°C→130°C (ΔT ~110°C). **Intercooler**: Cool to 30-40°C between stages (water-cooled or air-cooled heat exchangers, fin-tube or plate-fin type). Removes heat of compression (increases density, reduces work for next stage, improves efficiency 15-25%). Knockout drum: separate condensed moisture (air saturates at higher pressure, water condenses, removed as liquid, 0.1-0.5 L/m³ air depending on humidity). **Stages 2-4**: Repeat compression + cooling. Final pressure: 5-10 bar (older plants 8-10 bar, modern 5-7 bar with advanced expanders). Exit: 5-7 bar, 35-45°C, <1 g/m³ moisture (dew point -40°C @ pressure). **Compressor drive**: Electric motor (synchronous or induction, 10-50 MW for large plant), or steam turbine (integrated with process steam generation), or gas turbine (combined cycle, rare). Efficiency: 85-92% (polytropic). Power consumption: 0.35-0.50 kWh/Nm³ air compressed to 6 bar (single largest energy consumer, 60-70% of total plant electricity).

**Step 29-45: Pre-Purification - Removal of Impurities**
Remove H₂O, CO₂, hydrocarbons before cryogenic section (freeze at low temperatures, plug equipment). **[Molecular sieve adsorption](zeolite-adsorbent)**: Two-vessel pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system. Vessels: vertical columns 2-5m diameter, 8-15m tall, packed with adsorbent layers. Adsorbents: (1) Activated alumina Al₂O₃ (top layer, 20-30% bed height, removes bulk water, capacity 15-20% by weight). (2) Zeolite 13X or 5A (bottom layer, 70-80%, molecular sieve, pore size 10-13 Å, adsorbs H₂O, CO₂, hydrocarbons C₂-C₅). **Adsorption cycle** (4-8 hours): Compressed air (5-7 bar, 30°C) flows upward through Vessel A, impurities adsorb, clean air exits (dewpoint -70°C, <1 ppm CO₂, <0.1 ppm C₂+). Simultaneously Vessel B regenerates: depressurize to 1.2-1.5 bar, purge with waste nitrogen (opposite direction, 150-200°C heated), desorbs impurities, vent to atmosphere. Heat source: electric heaters or waste heat from compressor aftercoolers. **Cycle switch**: When Vessel A saturates (breakthrough detected by CO₂ or moisture analyzer), switch feed to Vessel B (freshly regenerated), regenerate Vessel A. Adsorbent life: 5-10 years (degrades from moisture cycling, attrition, replaced when capacity drops 20-30%). Purge gas: 5-15% of feed air (nitrogen-rich waste from cold box, recycled). Critical: CO₂ freezes at -78°C (dry ice), blocks cold heat exchangers, distillation column (must reduce to <1 ppm for -196°C operations).

**Step 46-65: Cooling and Liquefaction - Main [Heat Exchanger](plate-fin-exchanger)**
Cool purified air from 30°C to -190°C (approaching nitrogen boiling point -196°C). **[Plate-fin heat exchanger](plate-fin-exchanger)**: Aluminum brazed construction (thousands of thin plates 0.5-2mm spacing, corrugated fins between plates for turbulence, high surface area 500-1,500 m²/m³ volume). Concurrent streams: (1) Warm incoming air (5-7 bar, 30°C) flows through channels, cools. (2) Cold waste nitrogen (1-2 bar, -180°C) from distillation returns, warms (recovers refrigeration). (3) Liquid oxygen product (optionally) evaporates, cools incoming air. Countercurrent arrangement: warmest air meets warmest return stream, coldest air meets coldest return (maximize heat transfer, approach temperature 2-5°C, thermodynamic efficiency >95%). Multi-pass design: air makes 5-15 passes through exchanger, gradually cooling -50°C → -100°C → -150°C → -180°C. **Refrigeration source**: (1) Joule-Thomson expansion: throttle high-pressure air (30-40 bar side stream) through valve, isenthalpic expansion cools below inversion temperature (air inversion ~600 K, practical -50°C to -150°C range gives cooling). (2) Turbo-expander (more efficient): Expand air (5-7 bar → 1.2-1.5 bar) through radial turbine wheel (isentropic expansion, does work, extracts energy, temperature drops 80-120°C per stage). Expander: 50-85% efficiency, generates 5-15 MW power (recovered, drives compressor or generator). Combined Joule-Thomson + expander: modern plants use 2-3 expanders at different temperatures (-50°C, -120°C, -170°C) for staged refrigeration. Air liquefies: partial liquefaction ~20-40% by mass becomes liquid at -190°C, 5-6 bar (two-phase mixture enters distillation column).

**Step 66-88: Cryogenic Distillation - Separation of Components**
**[Double-column system](air-separation-unit)**: Industry-standard Linde-Frankl design (1920s invention, dominates). Two columns: Low-pressure column (LP, 1.2-1.5 bar) and High-pressure column (HP, 5-6 bar), thermally integrated. **High-pressure column** (lower column): Feeds two-phase air (-190°C, 5-6 bar), 30-50 sieve trays or structured packing (corrugated sheets, vapor flows up, liquid flows down). Boiling points @ 5-6 bar: N₂ -182°C, O₂ -173°C (shift from 1 bar values due to pressure). Nitrogen (lighter, more volatile) preferentially evaporates, rises to top. Oxygen (heavier, less volatile) stays liquid, descends to bottom. Argon (intermediate) concentrates at tray 5-8 from bottom (argon-rich ~10-12% Ar, 85% O₂, 3% N₂, crude argon side-draw for argon production plants). **Reboiler-condenser**: Top of HP column produces nitrogen vapor (-182°C, 5-6 bar), passes through condenser (tube bundle), condensed by evaporating liquid oxygen from LP column (thermodynamic coupling - one column's condenser is other's reboiler, no external refrigeration needed for distillation, ingenious energy integration). Liquid nitrogen: splits two streams (1) Reflux: returns to HP column top (provides liquid for downward flow, contact with rising vapor, separation). (2) Feed: flows to LP column (after expansion valve, pressure drops to 1.3 bar, temperature drops to -194°C, flashes partially to vapor). **Low-pressure column** (upper column): 50-90 trays or structured packing (taller, more separation stages needed at lower pressure). Liquid nitrogen feed enters top, enriched by distillation. Oxygen-rich liquid from HP column bottom also feeds to LP column mid-point (after sub-cooling and expansion). LP column operates 1.2-1.5 bar: N₂ boiling -196°C, O₂ -183°C (larger relative volatility α=2.5 vs 1.8 at high pressure, easier separation, higher purity achievable). **Products**: Top of LP column: gaseous nitrogen 99.9-99.999% purity (trace O₂ 10-100 ppm, Ar 5-50 ppm). Bottom: liquid oxygen 99.5-99.8% (trace Ar, N₂). Middle: crude argon side-draw (if argon production integrated, feeds argon column for further purification to 99.999%).

**Step 89-108: Nitrogen Product Purification and Compression**
Nitrogen from LP column top: 99.9% purity (industrial-grade), or 99.999% (high-purity), or 99.9999% (ultra-high-purity UHP for semiconductors). **Oxygen removal** (critical for semiconductor, ammonia synthesis): Trace O₂ (10-1,000 ppm) removed by: (1) Catalytic deoxo: pass through palladium or platinum catalyst at 200-400°C with 1-3% H₂ addition, reaction O₂ + 2H₂ → 2H₂O (combusts oxygen), then remove water by molecular sieve or refrigeration dryer. Reduces O₂ to <0.1 ppm. (2) Adsorption: zeolite or carbon molecular sieve (CMS) selectively adsorbs O₂ (kinetic separation, O₂ diffuses faster into narrow pores). PSA system, 2-4 vessels, cycle 1-5 minutes. Purity: 99.9999% N₂, <0.1 ppm O₂, <0.1 ppm moisture. (3) Membrane separation (polishing step): hollow-fiber polymer membranes, O₂ permeates faster than N₂, reject stream <1 ppm O₂. **Moisture removal**: Pass through molecular sieve dryer (regenerative, similar to feed air purification), dewpoint <-70°C (moisture <1 ppm). **Hydrocarbon removal**: Activated carbon bed (rare, only for UHP grades), removes ppb-level organics. **Gas nitrogen compression**: Gaseous product from cold box (-180°C, 1.3 bar) warms in main heat exchanger (recovers cold, exits 20-30°C), then compress to delivery pressure 10-300 bar (depending on customer requirements). Multi-stage centrifugal compressor (3-5 stages, intercooled), or reciprocating compressor for very high pressure (200-300 bar for cylinders). Power: 0.10-0.35 kWh/Nm³ for 10-200 bar compression. **Liquid nitrogen**: Alternatively, collect as liquid from column (-196°C, 1-3 bar), pump to higher pressure (5-50 bar, cryogenic centrifugal pump 80-85% efficient), store in insulated tanks, or load directly to tanker trucks. Liquid density: 0.807 kg/L @ -196°C. Boiling point: -196°C @ 1 bar, -183°C @ 5 bar, -170°C @ 20 bar.

**Step 109-125: Alternative Production - Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA)**
**On-site nitrogen generation**: PSA plants for customers needing 95-99.9% N₂ at lower scale (10-10,000 Nm³/h, vs 100,000+ for cryogenic). Advantages: no transport, lower capital (<$500k for small unit vs $100-500M cryogenic plant), fast startup (minutes vs hours). Disadvantages: lower purity (limited to 99.9%, typical 97-99%), higher operating cost per unit at large scale. **Principle**: Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) preferentially adsorbs oxygen (O₂ kinetic diameter 3.46 Å diffuses into 3-5 Å pores faster than N₂ 3.64 Å, equilibrium favors O₂). **PSA process**: Compressed air (5-10 bar, dried in pre-filter) enters Vessel A (packed with CMS pellets 1-3mm). O₂ adsorbs, N₂ passes through (enriched to 95-99.9% depending on cycle time, flow rate). After 30-120 seconds, switch feed to Vessel B (fresh), depressurize Vessel A to 1-1.2 bar (releases adsorbed O₂, vents to atmosphere as O₂-enriched air 25-35% O₂), purge with product N₂ (backflush, desorbs remaining O₂), re-pressurize with feed air, switch back. Cycle: 60-240 seconds total. Vessels: 2-4 (staggered for continuous production). Purity vs recovery tradeoff: 95% N₂ (80-85% recovery, 20% waste), 99% N₂ (65-75% recovery), 99.9% (50-60% recovery, half the air wasted, higher cost). Energy: 0.30-0.60 kWh/Nm³ N₂ produced (includes compression, control system). CMS life: 10-15 years (tolerates moisture better than zeolites, but gradual loss of selectivity from attrition, contamination).

**Step 126-142: Alternative Production - Membrane Separation**
**Hollow-fiber membrane**: Polymer fibers (polyimide, polysulfone, or cellulose acetate, 100-500 µm outer diameter, 50-250 µm inner, wall thickness 10-50 µm), bundled 10,000-100,000 fibers per module (1-2 m long, 0.1-0.3 m diameter). **Principle**: O₂ permeates through polymer wall faster than N₂ (permeability ratio O₂/N₂ = 4-10, depends on material). Compressed air (7-10 bar) enters fiber bore (inside), O₂-enriched permeate exits shell side (1-2 bar, 30-40% O₂), N₂-enriched retentate continues through bore, exits at 6-9 bar (90-99% N₂). **Single-stage**: Produces 90-95% N₂ (simple, low cost, sufficient for food packaging, inerting). **Two-stage**: First stage produces 95% N₂, second stage (using first-stage product as feed) produces 99% N₂. Purity limited to ~99% (membrane selectivity physical limit, high-purity requires impractical membrane area or multi-stages with diminishing returns). **Applications**: Small-scale (1-1,000 Nm³/h), on-site, portability (skid-mounted units, 20-ft container). Food packaging (bag flushing, modified atmosphere packaging MAP), tire inflation (aviation, racing, reduce O₂ to prevent rubber oxidation), laser cutting (purge gas, <1% O₂ acceptable). Energy: 0.25-0.45 kWh/Nm³ (lower than PSA due to simpler process, no adsorption/desorption cycling). Membrane life: 5-10 years (degrades from moisture, compressor oil contamination, requires pre-filtration).

**Step 143-160: Nitrogen Applications - Ammonia Synthesis**
**Largest consumer**: 75% of global nitrogen production (110 Mt/year) feeds Haber-Bosch ammonia plants. [Ammonia synthesis](ammonia-synthesis): N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃ (175 Mt NH₃/year globally). Nitrogen from ASU (air separation unit) or PSA: 99.9-99.999% purity required (O₂ <10 ppm poisons catalyst, CO₂ <50 ppm). Integrated plants: ASU adjacent to ammonia plant, gaseous N₂ pipeline (5-30 bar, ambient temperature) direct feed (no liquefaction, saves energy). Small plants: delivered liquid N₂ in tankers, evaporate on-site. Consumption: 0.467 tonnes N₂ per tonne NH₃ (stoichiometric 0.4667, actual 0.47-0.50 including purge losses). Ammonia → fertilizers (80%): urea, ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, direct application. Supports 50% of global food production (Haber-Bosch "fed the world", population 1.6B in 1900 → 8B in 2024, without synthetic nitrogen fertilizer 3-4B maximum sustainable by natural nitrogen fixation).

**Step 161-172: Applications - Inert Atmosphere and Chemical Processing**
**Inert blanketing**: Nitrogen displaces oxygen in chemical reactors, storage tanks, pipelines (prevents oxidation, combustion, explosion). Applications: (1) Petrochemical reactors (polymerization, hydrogenation, alkylation), maintain <100 ppm O₂. (2) Storage tanks for flammable liquids (gasoline, solvents, crude oil), N₂ pad prevents vapor ignition. (3) Food processing (oil/fat storage, grain silos, wine/beer tanks), prevent rancidity, oxidation. (4) Pharmaceuticals (API reactors, dryers, blenders), maintain product quality. Consumption: 1-50 Nm³/h per vessel (continuous purge or pressure control). **Semiconductor fabrication**: Ultra-high-purity N₂ (99.9999-99.99999%, <0.1 ppm O₂, <0.1 ppm H₂O) used as carrier gas, purge gas, chamber atmosphere. Applications: (1) Diffusion furnaces (annealing, drive-in of dopants, 700-1,100°C, N₂ prevents Si oxidation). (2) Chemical vapor deposition (CVD chamber purge between runs, prevent cross-contamination). (3) Photolithography (stepper environment, N₂ blanket prevents photoresist oxidation). (4) Wafer storage (FOUP boxes purged with N₂, <1 ppm O₂). Fab consumption: 10,000-100,000 Nm³/h (large 300mm fab), supplied by on-site ASU or bulk liquid N₂ tank farm + evaporators + filtration (point-of-use 0.003 µm particle filters, <0.1 ppb hydrocarbon).

**Step 173-185: Applications - Food Packaging and Cryogenics**
**Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP)**: Replace air in food packages with N₂ (or N₂/CO₂ mix) to extend shelf life. Oxygen causes: (1) Aerobic bacteria growth (spoilage). (2) Oxidative rancidity (fats/oils). (3) Color loss (meat myoglobin, vegetable pigments). (4) Vitamin degradation. N₂ atmosphere (99-100% N₂ for snacks/coffee, 70% N₂ + 30% CO₂ for fresh produce/meat) reduces O₂ to <0.5-2%, extends shelf life 2-5×. Equipment: Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) machines flush packages (bags, trays, cans) with N₂ gas-flush, vacuum then fill, or continuous flow while sealing. Consumption: 1-10 liters N₂ per package (chips, coffee, nuts, dried fruit, bakery). Purity: 99-99.9% (food-grade, moisture <10 ppm, CO₂ <300 ppm). Supply: Bulk liquid N₂ tank (5,000-20,000L on-site) + vaporizer, or PSA/membrane generator. **Cryogenic freezing**: Liquid nitrogen (-196°C) for rapid food freezing (IQF individual quick frozen shrimp, berries, vegetables). Advantages: Fast (minutes vs hours in mechanical freezers), small ice crystals (preserves texture, cellular structure), portable (truck-mounted LN₂ system). Consumption: 0.8-1.5 kg LN₂ per kg food (depends on initial temp, water content, target temp). Cost: $0.20-0.80/kg LN₂ → $0.16-1.20/kg food frozen (higher than mechanical but quality/speed benefits). **Medical cryogenics**: Liquid N₂ for cryopreservation (sperm, eggs, embryos, tissue samples, cell cultures), dermatology (wart/lesion removal), cryosurgery. Storage dewars: 20-500L, vacuum-insulated, boiloff 1-5% per day (replenish weekly).

**Step 186-195: Storage, Transport, Safety, Market, and Pricing**
**Storage - Gaseous**: High-pressure cylinders (200-300 bar, 40-50L water capacity, holds 8-10 m³ nitrogen), tube trailers (200-300 bar, 12-20 tubes, total 3,000-5,000 m³). Steel construction (nitrogen non-corrosive). **Storage - Liquid**: Cryogenic tanks (vacuum-insulated, double-wall, perlite or multilayer insulation MLI). On-site bulk tanks: 5,000-50,000L (vertical or horizontal, 1.5-3 bar operating), boiloff 0.2-1% per day (heat leak through insulation, relief valve vents excess pressure, losses). Tanker trucks: 20,000-50,000L, deliver to customer sites, transfer liquid via cryogenic pumps or pressure differential. ISO containers: 20,000-24,000L, intermodal (ship, rail, truck), rental or lease. **Transport**: Gaseous (short distance, low volume), liquid (long distance, high volume, economical for >100 km). Pipeline: Rare (only integrated ammonia complexes, petrochemical clusters), 10-50 km, insulated or ambient depending on pressure/flow. **Safety**: Asphyxiation hazard (N₂ displaces oxygen, odorless, colorless, no warning). Confined space entry risk: enclosed tanks, pits, manholes filled with N₂ (heavier than air when cold) → unconsciousness in seconds, death in minutes without oxygen (<19.5% O₂ dangerous, <6% fatal). Precautions: O₂ monitors (alarm <19.5%), ventilation, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), buddy system, confined space permits. Cryogenic burns: Liquid N₂ (-196°C) causes severe frostbite on skin contact (seconds), eye damage (blindness). PPE: insulated gloves, face shield, apron, closed-toe shoes. Pressure hazard: Liquid-to-gas expansion ratio 1:694 (1L liquid → 694L gas @ 20°C), rapid vaporization in enclosed space causes pressure burst (tanks must have pressure relief valves, rupturediscs). **Market**: 150 Mt/year N₂ (2023), China 35%, USA 15%, Europe 15%, India 8%, Middle East 5%, other 22%. On-site generation (ASU, PSA) 70%, merchant (delivered liquid/gas) 30%. **Pricing**: Gaseous N₂ (high-pressure cylinder) $2-10/m³ (depends on purity, volume, location). Liquid N₂ (bulk delivery) $0.10-0.50/kg ($0.08-0.40/L). On-site PSA (cost amortized) $0.05-0.20/m³. Ammonia-plant integrated ASU (internal transfer pricing) $0.03-0.10/m³. Semiconductor UHP N₂ $5-20/m³ (extensive purification, point-of-use filtration, quality assurance). **Economics**: Cryogenic ASU capital cost $300-700/tonne/day capacity (1,000 tonne/day plant = $300-700M), economics favor large scale (>500 tonne/day), payback 8-15 years for merchant plants, 5-10 years for ammonia-integrated. Energy: 0.4-0.6 kWh/kg N₂ (includes compression, purification, liquefaction if applicable), electricity cost $20-40/tonne N₂ @ $50-70/MWh power. Carbon footprint: 0.2-0.4 kg CO₂e/kg N₂ (electricity generation, 0.4-0.7 kg CO₂/kWh grid mix). Green N₂: renewable electricity (hydro, wind, solar) → zero carbon (Iceland, Norway, Chile, Texas wind-powered ASUs).

Price: $0.15/kg represents bulk gaseous nitrogen (99.9% purity, delivered or on-site PSA). Liquid nitrogen $0.20-0.50/kg, high-purity 99.999% gaseous $0.30-1.00/kg, semiconductor UHP 99.9999% $2-5/kg. Ammonia synthesis plants (largest consumer) pay $0.05-0.15/kg for integrated ASU nitrogen. Food-grade (MAP, cryogenic freezing) $0.15-0.60/kg. Per chip allocation: minimal (nitrogen used in fab as ambient gas, cost absorbed into facility overhead, fraction of a cent per chip for gas itself, primary cost is electricity for fab cleanroom pressurization and gas generation systems).
