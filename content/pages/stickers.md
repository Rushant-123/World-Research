Self-adhesive labels applied to products for identification, regulatory compliance, and branding. Printed vinyl or paper facestock with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing. MacBook labels include: model identifier, serial number, regulatory markings (FCC, CE, RoHS), barcodes, and country of origin. Durability requirements: resistant to abrasion, chemicals, temperature, and UV exposure for product lifetime (5-10 years).

## What is it?

A multi-layer construction: printed facestock (vinyl, polyester, or paper) coated with pressure-sensitive adhesive, protected by a silicone-coated release liner. Facestock thickness: 50-100 microns. Adhesive thickness: 20-40 microns. Liner thickness: 60-100 microns. Printing methods: flexography, digital inkjet, thermal transfer, or screen printing. Variable data: serialization via thermal transfer or laser marking. Die-cut to final shape with precision ±0.1mm. Adhesive types: permanent, removable, or repositionable. Surface finish: gloss, matte, or textured.
