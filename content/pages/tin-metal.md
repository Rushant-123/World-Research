# How to Make Tin Metal

Soft, ductile metal - primary use in solder (electronics assembly). Also: tinplate (steel cans), chemicals (PVC stabilizers), alloys (bronze, pewter). Low melting point (232°C) ideal for soldering. Global production: 350,000 tonnes/year. China: 100,000 tonnes (29%), Indonesia: 80,000 tonnes (23%), Myanmar: 45,000 tonnes (13%).

**Step 1-12: [Tin Ore (Cassiterite)](cassiterite-ore) Mining**
Tin ore: cassiterite (SnO₂, 78.8% Sn). Density: 6.8-7.1 g/cm³ (very heavy - enables gravity concentration). Occurrence: primary deposits (hard rock, veins in granite), secondary deposits (alluvial/placer, weathered and transported by water, concentrate in stream gravels). Primary mining: underground or open pit, drill-blast-haul, similar to other hard rock mining. Secondary mining: dredging (floating dredge with bucket ladder excavates riverbed, 10-30m deep), gravel pump (hydraulic mining), or small-scale (artisanal miners with pans, sluices, hand tools). Ore grade: primary 0.1-1% Sn, secondary (placers) 0.01-0.3% Sn but easier to concentrate. Major deposits: Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia tin belt), China (Yunnan), South America (Bolivia, Brazil), Africa (Nigeria, Rwanda, DRC - conflict minerals concern).

**Step 13-28: Concentration by Gravity Separation**
Cassiterite density (6.8-7.1 g/cm³) much higher than gangue minerals (quartz 2.65, feldspar 2.6). Gravity concentration very effective. Crush ore to -2mm. Jig: pulsating water current stratifies particles by density. Heavy cassiterite sinks, light gangue floats. Concentrate from jig: 20-40% Sn. Shaking table: inclined deck with riffles, reciprocating motion + water flow. Heavy minerals (cassiterite, also tungsten WO₃, tantalum Ta₂O₅ if present) travel along riffles, light minerals wash over. Concentrate: 40-60% Sn. Spiral concentrator: slurry flows down helical channel, centrifugal + gravity forces separate by density. Continuous process, low capital cost. For very fine cassiterite (<100 µm): centrifugal concentrator (Falcon, Knelson) or flotation (although cassiterite floats poorly, fatty acid collectors at pH 5-6).

**Step 29-42: Smelting in [Reverberatory Furnace](reverberatory-furnace)**
Charge furnace with tin concentrate (50-70% Sn), coal/anthracite (reducing agent + fuel), flux (limestone or silica - forms slag with impurities). Reverberatory furnace: rectangular chamber, 5m × 15m floor, 3m tall, arched roof. Fuel (coal, gas, or oil) burns above charge (radiant heat), flame reflects off roof onto charge. Temperature: 1,200-1,400°C. Reactions: SnO₂ + 2C → Sn + 2CO (carbothermic reduction). Also: SnO₂ + C → SnO + CO (partial reduction), SnO + C → Sn + CO (further reduction). Iron impurities: FeO + SiO₂ → FeSiO₃ (slag). Copper, lead, arsenic, antimony: report to slag or volatilize. Furnace hearth: molten tin pools at bottom (density 7.3 g/cm³ liquid at 1,300°C), slag floats (density 2.8-3.2 g/cm³). Tap tin from bottom spout every 4-6 hours. Tap slag from side port. Tin recovery: 95-98%. Product: crude tin, 96-99% Sn, 0.5-2% Fe, 0.1-0.5% Cu, 0.1-0.3% As, 0.1-0.2% Pb, 0.1% Sb.

**Step 43-58: Fire Refining (Drossing and Boiling)**
Crude tin contains impurities affecting solder performance (iron causes dross, copper hardens, lead reduces wetting). Remove by sequential fire refining. **Drossing (remove iron):** Heat tin to 330-350°C in cast iron kettle. Add sulfur powder (0.5-1% by weight). Sulfur reacts with iron: Fe + S → FeS (iron sulfide, insoluble, floats as dross). Skim dross from surface. Repeat until iron <0.01%. **Boiling (remove arsenic, antimony):** Heat tin to 800-900°C under reducing conditions (stir with green wood poles - releases CO and H₂ which reduce As, Sb to volatile forms). Arsenic: as As₂O₃ vapor (bp 465°C sublimes), collected in dust chambers. Antimony: forms Sb₂O₃ (bp 1,425°C but volatilizes as vapor at 800-900°C in reducing atmosphere). Liquation: slow cooling to 300°C, high-melting impurities (Cu, Fe) crystallize first, pour off molten pure tin. Refined tin: 99.5-99.8% Sn.

**Step 59-75: [Electrolytic Refining](electrolytic-refining)**
For high-purity tin (99.95-99.99% Sn, required for electronics-grade solder). Electrolytic cell: concrete tank lined with PVC or rubber, 2m × 4m × 1.5m deep. Electrolyte: fluosilicic acid (H₂SiF₆, 100-150 g/L) + sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, 50-80 g/L), 35-40°C. Anodes: cast crude tin slabs, 1m × 0.5m × 30mm, 150-200 kg each. Suspend 20-40 anodes in cell. Cathodes: thin pure tin starter sheets (1mm thick, 1m × 0.5m) or stainless steel blanks. Interleave anodes and cathodes, spacing 50-80mm. Apply DC current: 150-250 A/m² current density, 0.1-0.3 V per cell. Cells in series: 200-400 cells, 30-60 kA total. At anode (oxidation): Sn → Sn²⁺ + 2e⁻. Tin dissolves, enters electrolyte as Sn²⁺ ions. Impurities: noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) don't dissolve (fall as anode slime, recover). Base metals (Fe, As, Sb, Pb) dissolve but don't plate (stay in solution or precipitate). At cathode (reduction): Sn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Sn. Pure tin plates onto cathode. Current efficiency: 85-95%. Cathode tin: 99.95-99.995% Sn.

**Step 76-88: Cathode Harvesting and Casting**
Remove cathodes after 3-5 days (tin deposit 10-15mm thick, 40-60 kg per cathode). Strip tin from starter sheet (peel off) or dissolve starter (if steel). Melt cathode tin in gas-fired furnace at 300-350°C. Add deoxidizers (aluminum shot, 0.01% or magnesium) to remove dissolved oxygen. Skim dross. Cast into ingots: molds 10-50 kg (standard tin ingot 25 kg, 300mm × 150mm × 50mm). Rapid cooling (water-cooled mold) produces fine grain structure. Stamp ingot with brand, purity, lot number. London Metal Exchange (LME) brands: high-grade tin (99.85% min, Grade A), refined tin (99.95% min), high-purity tin (99.99% min). Test purity: wet chemical analysis or ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry). Major impurities to test: Pb (<0.05%), As (<0.05%), Sb (<0.05%), Cu (<0.05%), Bi (<0.03%), Fe (<0.01%).

**Step 89-102: Alloying for Solder Production**
Pure tin rarely used (oxidizes rapidly, forms whiskers, high cost). Alloy for solder: **SAC305 (lead-free):** 96.5% Sn, 3.0% Ag, 0.5% Cu. Melting point: 217-220°C. Weigh metals precisely: ±0.1% tolerance. Melt tin at 350-400°C in crucible. Add silver and copper (higher melting points dissolve in molten tin). Stir with graphite rod or induction stirring. Hold at 400°C for 30 minutes (homogenization). Sample, test composition by XRF or ICP. Cast into pigs (25 kg ingots) for sale to solder manufacturers (wire, paste, preforms), or process directly to solder products. **SnPb eutectic (legacy, RoHS-banned):** 63% Sn, 37% Pb. Melting point: 183°C. Used in aerospace/military (exempt from RoHS). **SAC0307 (low-silver):** 99.0% Sn, 0.3% Ag, 0.7% Cu. Lower cost, slightly higher melting point (227°C).

**Step 103-115: Solder Product Forms**
**Wire:** Cast alloy into billets, extrude through die (6-25mm diameter), draw through carbide dies to final diameter (0.5-3mm typical for hand soldering, 0.2-0.8mm for wave soldering). Flux-core wire: hollow wire filled with rosin flux (20-25% flux by weight) - eliminates separate flux application. Spool: 0.25-1 kg for hand soldering, 5-20 kg for automated soldering. **Bar:** Cast into bars (500g to 5 kg) for wave soldering pots. **Paste:** Mix solder powder (<45 µm spherical particles, made by gas atomization) with flux vehicle (rosin, activators, solvents, rheology modifiers). Paste: 85-92% metal by weight. Viscosity: 150-250 Pa·s (thixotropic). Stencil-print onto PCB pads, place components, reflow in oven. Shelf life: 6-12 months refrigerated. **Preforms:** Stamp or cut thin solder sheet (0.1-0.5mm) into specific shapes (rings, washers, custom). Used for heat sink attachment, die attach, hermetic seal lids.

**Step 116-128: Quality and Specifications**
Alloy composition: test each batch by XRF (non-destructive, ±0.05% accuracy) or ICP (destructive, ±0.01% accuracy). Dross content: measure dross formation by heating sample to 350°C for 24 hours, weigh oxide layer. Spec: <0.05% dross. Wetting balance test: immerse test coupon in molten solder, measure wetting force (balance). Good solder: force >0.5 mN, wetting time <2 seconds. Spread test: place solder ball on copper plate with flux, heat to liquidus +30°C, measure spread diameter. Spec: >80% spread. IPC-J-STD-004 (flux standard), IPC-J-STD-005 (solder paste standard), IPC-J-STD-006 (solder alloy standard). RoHS compliance: test for lead (<0.1% for RoHS compliance, typically <0.01% in SAC alloys from non-recycled sources). Conflict minerals (tin from Myanmar, DRC, Rwanda): supply chain audit, smelter certification (Responsible Minerals Initiative - RMI, Conflict-Free Smelter Program - CFSP).

**Step 129-140: Market and Economics**
Global tin consumption: 350,000 tonnes/year. Solder: 50% (175,000 tonnes, lead-free transition increased tin content per joint). Tinplate: 20% (food cans, steel coated with 2-10 µm tin by electroplating). Chemicals: 15% (PVC stabilizers - organotin compounds, biocides). Alloys: 10% (bronze, bearing alloys, pewter). Other: 5% (float glass production, superconducting alloys). Tin price (2010-2024): $15,000-30,000/tonne, average $22,000/tonne. Volatile: supply disruptions (Indonesian export bans, artisanal mining fluctuations), demand surges (electronics growth, lead-free conversion). Reserves: 4.6 million tonnes (USGS). R/P ratio: 13 years at current rate (but recycling, new deposits extend). Recycling: ~30% of supply from recycled tin (solder dross, tin-bearing scrap, tinplate scrap). Environmental: artisanal tin mining causes deforestation, river sedimentation (Southeast Asia). Offshore dredging (Indonesia) impacts marine ecosystems. Smelting emissions: SO₂ (from sulfur in ore), particulates (arsenic, lead). Regulations tightening, require scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators.

Price: $0.35/kg ($350/tonne, lower than market due to supply chain abstraction - represents input cost for tin metal entering solder alloy production). Actual LME tin: $20-30/kg ($20,000-30,000/tonne). Per solder ball: 0.001-0.003g tin × $25/kg = $0.000025-0.000075 per ball. Per chip package: 0.05-0.5g solder (BGA, LGA) × $25/kg = $0.0013-0.0125 per package. In supply chain model, $0.35 represents simplified allocation, not spot market price.
