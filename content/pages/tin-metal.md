High-purity tin metal (99.95-99.99% Sn) from cassiterite ore via gravity concentration, smelting, and electrorefining. Primary use: lead-free solder (SAC alloys, 50% of demand). Applications: solder/electronics (50%), tinplate steel cans (20%), chemicals/PVC stabilizers (15%), bronze/bearing alloys (10%), float glass/other (5%). Global production: 350,000-380,000 tonnes/year refined tin. China: 100,000 t (29%), Indonesia: 80,000 t (23%), Myanmar: 50,000 t (14%), Peru: 18,000 t (5%), Bolivia: 17,000 t (5%).

**Step 1-18: [Cassiterite Ore](cassiterite-ore) Mining - Alluvial and Hard Rock Deposits**

Tin ore: cassiterite SnO₂ (78.8% Sn theoretical, only economic tin mineral). Physical properties: density 6.8-7.1 g/cm³ (very high, enables gravity concentration), hardness 6-7 Mohs (durable, resists weathering), color black/brown (opaque, metallic luster). **Deposit types:** (1) Primary hard rock: veins/greisen in granite (Cornwall UK historic, Erzgebirge Germany/Czech, China Dachang/Gejiu, Bolivia Llallagua). Ore grade: 0.1-1.0% Sn, associated minerals quartz, topaz, fluorite, wolframite WO₃, tantalite Ta₂O₅. Mine: underground (sublevel stoping, cut-and-fill) or open-pit if shallow. (2) Secondary alluvial/placer: weathered cassiterite transported by rivers, concentrated in stream gravels (Southeast Asia tin belt Myanmar/Thailand/Malaysia, Indonesia Bangka/Belitung islands, Brazil Rondônia, Nigeria Jos plateau, DRC eastern provinces). Ore grade: 0.01-0.3% Sn (lower than primary but easy processing, higher cassiterite liberation). **Alluvial mining (60% of production):** Dredge mining - floating platform with bucket-ladder (30-60 buckets, 150-500L capacity each, continuous chain), excavate riverbed/valley floor to 10-30m depth, capacity 100-500 m³/hour. Gravel pump mining - high-pressure water jets mobilize sediment, pump slurry to processing plant (monitor, 300mm diameter nozzle, 8-15 bar pressure, 200-600 m³/hour). Small-scale artisanal - hand panning, sluice boxes, gravel pits (10-40% of Myanmar/Indonesia/DRC production, informal sector, environmental/conflict minerals concerns).

**Step 19-38: Gravity Concentration - Exploiting Cassiterite Density**

Cassiterite density 6.8-7.1 g/cm³ vastly exceeds gangue (quartz 2.65, feldspar 2.6, clay 2.5-2.7, ilmenite 4.7, rutile 4.2). Gravity methods extremely effective. **Crushing (primary ore):** Jaw crusher (800×600mm, 100-300 t/h) reduce hard rock to <100mm, roll crusher (<25mm). Alluvial ore pre-screened, minimal crushing (gravel already loose). **Screening:** Vibrating screens (10mm, 2mm, 0.5mm decks), classify size fractions (coarse >10mm hand-sort or re-crush, medium 2-10mm to jigs, fine 0.1-2mm to tables, slimes <0.1mm to spirals/centrifugal). **Jig concentration:** Jig separators - pulsating water column stratifies particles by density. Harz jig (side-pulsed), Baum jig (piston-pulsed), or diaphragm jig (air-pulsed membrane), capacity 5-30 t/h per m² screen area. Feed: 2-25mm particles, 20-40% solids slurry. Hutch water pulses up-down (cycle 1-2 Hz), heavy cassiterite sinks through screen bed (ragging layer steel balls or stones), light gangue floats, washes over weir. Middling layer periodically discharged (re-jig). Concentrate: 30-50% Sn (jig concentrate, contains cassiterite + some heavy gangue ilmenite/magnetite/garnet). Recovery: 60-80% Sn (coarse cassiterite >1mm, fine particles lost to tailings). **Shaking table concentration:** [Shaking tables](shaking-table) - inclined deck (rubber, linoleum, or fiberglass with wooden/rubber riffles), reciprocating motion (250-300 strokes/min, 10-20mm amplitude) + water flow (10-80 L/min per m width). Feed: 0.1-3mm particles, 15-25% solids, distributed across deck width. Longitudinal shake + cross-flow water: heavy minerals (cassiterite, also tungsten, tantalum if present) travel along riffles to concentrate edge, light minerals wash diagonally to tailings edge. Multiple products: concentrate (high-grade, 50-70% Sn), middlings (20-40% Sn, re-table), tailings (<0.5% Sn, discard). Table capacity: 0.5-2 t/h per m² (lower than jigs, but higher precision). Recovery: 85-95% Sn >0.1mm. **Spiral concentrators:** Helical channel (fiberglass, 5-6 turns, 1.5-2m diameter, 4-6m tall), slurry flows down (gravity + centrifugal forces), density stratification. Feed: 0.05-2mm, 15-30% solids, 1-3 t/h per spiral. Low capital/operating cost, no moving parts. Concentrate: 40-60% Sn. Used for fine cassiterite or large-scale alluvial operations (100-500 spirals in parallel).

**Step 39-58: Fine Cassiterite Recovery and Concentrate Preparation**

**Centrifugal concentration:** Falcon concentrator, Knelson concentrator - spinning bowl (300-1,200 rpm, 60-300 G force), fluidization water, concentrate heavy minerals in grooves/pockets. Feed: 0.01-0.5mm ultrafine cassiterite (slimes from tables/spirals). Capacity: 0.5-5 t/h per unit. Concentrate: 30-50% Sn from slimes (otherwise lost to tailings). **Flotation (supplementary):** Cassiterite flotation difficult (surface oxidation reduces hydrophobicity). Fatty acid collectors (oleic acid, tall oil, 0.5-2 kg/t) at pH 5-6, sulfosuccinate auxiliaries. Flotation cells: 5-10 m³, residence 10-20 min. Recovery: 50-70% of -0.1mm cassiterite (lower than sulfide flotation, not primary method). Mostly used for slime recovery or complex ores. **Magnetic separation:** Remove magnetic gangue (magnetite Fe₃O₄, ilmenite FeTiO₃) from cassiterite concentrate. Low-intensity magnetic separator (drum magnet 0.1-0.3 T) removes magnetite. High-intensity separator (induced roll 1.2-2.0 T) removes ilmenite, hematite. Cassiterite non-magnetic, reports to non-mag product. **Concentrate upgrade:** Multi-stage gravity circuits (jigs → tables → spirals → centrifugal, clean/re-clean middlings) achieve final concentrate 60-75% Sn. Dry concentrate: rotary dryer or filter press to <1% moisture (prevent caking, safety for smelting - moisture + high heat = steam explosion). **Assay:** Sample concentrate (riffle splitter, cone-and-quarter), grind to <75 µm, digest in acid (aqua regia or HCl + oxidizer), analyze Sn by ICP-OES or titration. Also measure Fe, As, Pb, Sb, Cu (impurities affect smelting), Ta, Nb (valuable byproducts). **Blending:** Mix concentrate batches to consistent feed (65-72% Sn target, <5% Fe, <0.5% As, <0.1% S). Blending silo or batch blending on concrete pad.

**Step 59-78: Smelting in Reverberatory Furnace - Crude Tin Production**

Reduce cassiterite SnO₂ to metallic tin using carbon. **[Reverberatory furnace](reverberatory-furnace) design:** Rectangular chamber 4-8m wide, 12-20m long, 2-3m tall, arched refractory roof (silica brick or high-alumina brick, 1,200-1,400°C hot face), hearth floor (rammed carbon or magnesia, sloped to tap hole), sidewalls (magnesia-chrome brick). Capacity: 2,000-8,000 t/year tin metal (smaller than copper/lead smelters, tin niche metal). **Charge preparation:** Mix cassiterite concentrate (65-72% Sn, 1,000-1,500 kg batch) + reductant [metallurgical coke](metallurgical-coke) or anthracite coal (20-35% of charge mass, provides carbon + fuel) + flux [limestone](limestone) CaCO₃ or silica (3-8%, forms fluid slag with iron/silicates). Charge composition calculated: C:SnO₂ molar ratio 2:1 (stoichiometric SnO₂ + 2C → Sn + 2CO), excess carbon 10-20% ensures complete reduction. **Furnace operation:** Load charge onto hearth (front door or roof ports), distribute evenly (2-4 tonne batch). Fire burners: [natural gas](natural-gas), fuel oil, or coal dust (800-1,200 kW thermal, flame above charge, radiant heat reflects off roof). Temperature: 1,200-1,400°C (above tin melting point 232°C, promote reaction kinetics, but below excessive vaporization loss). **Reduction reactions:** Primary: SnO₂ + 2C → Sn + 2CO (carbothermic reduction, endothermic ΔH +360 kJ/mol, requires heat input). Intermediate: SnO₂ + C → SnO + CO (partial reduction, SnO vapor), SnO + C → Sn + CO (further reduction). Side reactions: FeO + C → Fe + CO (iron reduces, alloys with tin, later removed in refining), CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (flux calcines, forms slag), CaO + SiO₂ + FeO → Ca-Fe silicate slag (density 2.8-3.2 g/cm³, floats on tin). **Phase separation:** Molten tin (density 7.3 g/cm³ liquid at 1,300°C) pools at hearth bottom, slag floats. Smelting time: 4-8 hours (heat charge, reduction, settling).

**Step 79-98: Tapping, Slag Treatment, and Crude Tin Composition**

**Tin tapping:** Drill tap hole at hearth lowest point (clay plug seals between taps), molten tin flows to ladle (cast iron, 500-2,000 kg capacity) or directly to refining kettles. Tap temperature: 400-600°C (above melting point 232°C, fluidity, but cool to minimize oxidation). Tap rate: 500-2,000 kg/hour (gravity flow, controlled by tap hole diameter). Close tap hole: ram clay plug. **Slag tapping:** Separate tap hole (higher level) or same hole after tin fully drained. Slag to granulation (water quench, shatters to sand) or slow cool (dump into pits). Slag composition: 35-50% SiO₂, 15-30% FeO, 10-20% CaO, 5-15% Al₂O₃, 1-4% SnO (tin loss). Slag treatment: crush, grind, re-smelt in electric furnace or slag fuming furnace (add more carbon, reduce residual SnO, recover additional tin 50-70%). **Crude tin composition:** 96-99% Sn (reverberatory furnace product, directly from smelting), 0.1-1.5% Fe (major impurity, co-reduces from cassiterite iron content), 0.05-0.5% Cu (from ore or scrap), 0.05-0.3% As (arsenic in cassiterite), 0.02-0.2% Pb (lead impurity), 0.02-0.15% Sb (antimony impurity), 0.01-0.1% Bi (bismuth). Impurities affect solder properties: Fe causes dross formation (oxidizes rapidly, surface scum), Cu hardens alloy, As/Sb/Pb reduce wetting (poor solder joints). Must refine to 99.85-99.99% for electronics. **Tin recovery:** 94-97% from concentrate to crude tin (losses 3-6% to slag, fume, spills). Energy: 3-6 GJ/tonne tin (fuel for smelting, electricity for auxiliaries).

**Step 99-118: Fire Refining - Drossing, Liquation, and Boiling**

Remove impurities by sequential pyrometallurgical treatments. **Kettle design:** Cast iron kettles (cylindrical or rectangular, 5-20 tonne capacity, induction heating or gas burners, 300-900°C range). Refractory lining minimal (tin low melting point, cast iron adequate). **Step 1 - Drossing (remove iron):** Heat crude tin to 280-350°C in kettle. Add sulfur powder (flowers of sulfur, 0.3-1.0% of tin mass) or pyrite FeS₂, stir with iron or graphite rod. Sulfur reacts: Fe + S → FeS (iron sulfide, melting point 1,188°C, insoluble in molten tin at 300°C). FeS forms dross (black crusty layer, floats on surface, density 4.8 g/cm³ vs 7.0 for molten tin). Skim dross with perforated ladle (remove without excessive tin loss). Repeat: test sample (cool, break, inspect for sparkles - metallic Fe particles), if present add more sulfur. Typically 2-4 drossing cycles. Final: Fe <0.02% (specification for refined tin). Dross: 2-8% of crude tin mass, contains 40-70% Sn (send to slag smelter, recover tin). **Step 2 - Liquation (crystal segregation):** Partially solidify tin to separate high-melting impurities. Heat tin to 350-400°C (fully molten), cool slowly to 250-270°C (below melting point of intermetallic compounds but above pure tin 232°C). Crystals form: Cu₆Sn₅ (MP 415°C), FeSn₂ (MP 508°C), SnSb (MP 424°C). Stir gently, crystals settle or float (density differences). Decant liquid tin to another kettle (90-95% of mass, reduced Cu/Fe/Sb). Residue: hard-head or dross cake (5-10% mass, 30-60% Sn, enriched in Cu/Fe/Sb, recycle to smelter). Liquation achieves: Fe <0.01%, Cu <0.05%, Sb <0.05%.

**Step 119-138: Boiling and Oxidation Refining**

**Step 3 - Boiling (remove volatile elements As, Sb):** Heat tin to 850-950°C (well above normal processing, special high-temp kettle or furnace). Insert green wood poles (hardwood, moisture content 15-30%) below surface, poles char and release gases CO + H₂ + hydrocarbons. Alternatively inject natural gas, propane, or ammonia. Reducing atmosphere reacts: As₂O₃ (arsenic oxide in tin) + 3H₂ → 2As + 3H₂O, metallic arsenic vaporizes (vapor pressure 1 atm at 616°C, rapid evaporation at 850-900°C). Similarly Sb: Sb₂O₃ + reducing gas → Sb vapor (BP 1,587°C but volatile as sub-oxide Sb₂O at 850-950°C in reducing conditions). Fumes: collect in baghouse or scrubber (arsenic trioxide dust, toxic, hazardous waste disposal or sold to chemical industry). Boiling time: 2-6 hours (until As+Sb <0.05% combined). Monitor: sample, cool, chemical analysis (AAS or ICP). **Step 4 - Oxidation (alternative/supplementary):** Blow air through molten tin at 700-900°C. Impurities oxidize preferentially (more reactive than Sn): 4As + 3O₂ → 2As₂O₃ (sublimes as white fume, BP 465°C), 4Sb + 3O₂ → 2Sb₂O₃ (BP 1,425°C but volatilizes), 2Pb + O₂ → 2PbO (litharge, floats as dross, skim). Some tin oxidizes: Sn + O₂ → SnO₂ (tin ash, 1-3% loss to dross). Oxidation refining: less common than boiling (higher tin loss), used if wood/gas unavailable. **Step 5 - Final liquation:** Repeat crystal segregation at 270-300°C, remove traces of Cu/Fe. **Fire-refined tin:** 99.5-99.85% Sn (meets LME Standard Grade 99.85% min), impurities: <0.04% Pb, <0.04% As, <0.04% Sb, <0.03% Cu, <0.015% Bi, <0.015% Fe, <0.005% Zn. Adequate for tinplate, some solders. Electronics-grade requires electrorefining.

**Step 139-160: Electrolytic Refining - High-Purity Tin**

Produce 99.95-99.995% Sn for lead-free solder, semiconductor packaging. **[Electrorefining cell](electrolytic-refining):** Concrete or steel tank lined with acid-resistant polymer (polyethylene, polypropylene, PVDF), 1.5×3.5×1.5m dimensions, capacity 8-15 m³. Electrolyte: fluosilicic acid H₂SiF₆ (hexafluorosilicic acid, 100-150 g/L, 0.7-1.0 M) + sulfuric acid H₂SO₄ (50-80 g/L, 0.5-0.8 M) + tin Sn²⁺ (12-20 g/L as stannous ion). Additives: peptone or gelatin (2-5 g/L, smoothing agent, fine grain deposit), β-naphthol or cresol (0.1-0.5 g/L, prevent SnO₂ formation, stabilize Sn²⁺). Temperature: 35-40°C (heated by immersion heaters or heat exchangers, optimal conductivity, prevent SnF₄ precipitation). **Anodes:** Cast crude or fire-refined tin slabs (1,000×500×25mm, 120-180 kg each), suspend vertically (tin hooks on copper bus bars). Spacing: 15-30 anodes per cell, 80-100mm apart. Purity: 96-99.8% Sn (accept crude or pre-refined). Lifetime: 7-14 days (dissolve to thin remnant, recycle). **Cathodes:** Thin tin starter sheets (1,000×500×0.5mm, 2-3 kg, prepared in separate plating cell with stainless steel blanks) or stainless steel 316L permanent cathodes. Interleave with anodes (16-31 cathodes per cell). **Current:** DC rectifier (2,000-6,000 A per cell, 0.12-0.25 V per cell, series connection 50-200 cells = 100-300 kA total, 6-50V bus). Current density: 120-250 A/m² (cathode area 1.0 m² per side, 240-500 A per cathode). Lower than copper refining (tin less conductive, higher overpotential).

**Step 161-180: Electrorefining Reactions and Cathode Harvesting**

**Anode reaction (oxidation):** Sn → Sn²⁺ + 2e⁻ (tin dissolves as stannous ion, E° = -0.136 V vs SHE). Fluosilicic acid stabilizes Sn²⁺ (prevents oxidation to Sn⁴⁺, forms SnF₄ precipitate if pH rises). Impurities: noble metals (Cu partially, Ag, Au, Bi partially) remain as anode slime (fall to cell bottom, collect). Active metals (Fe, As, Sb, Pb, Zn) dissolve but don't plate efficiently (stay in solution or precipitate, bleed electrolyte to remove). **Cathode reaction (reduction):** Sn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Sn (pure tin plates on cathode, fine-grained crystalline deposit). Deposition potential: -0.136 V (thermodynamic), actual -0.2 to -0.3 V (overpotential). Competing reaction (prevent): 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂ (hydrogen evolution if voltage too high, embrittles deposit). Smoothing agents (peptone) adsorb on cathode, promote uniform plating (prevent dendrites, bright smooth surface). **Current efficiency:** 88-95% (side reactions: Sn²⁺ oxidation by air, H₂ evolution, loss 5-12%). Lower than copper (tin chemistry more complex, Sn²⁺/Sn⁴⁺ equilibrium). **Plating time:** 3-6 days, cathode grows to 35-55 kg (22-28mm thick, both sides). Harvest: crane lifts cathodes, strip tin sheets (peel off starter, or dissolve starter if steel, or permanent cathode direct use). Inspect: smooth, silver-white metallic luster, no nodules/shorts/burns. **Cathode tin quality:** 99.95-99.995% Sn (5N to 5.5N purity), typical 99.95% (IPC J-STD-006 High Grade). Impurities: <0.015% Pb, <0.015% As, <0.010% Sb, <0.010% Cu, <0.005% Bi, <0.005% Fe, <0.003% Zn, <0.002% Cd. Oxygen content: <5 ppm (low oxygen essential for solder wetting). Silver content: <3 ppm (unless intentionally added for alloys). **Cathode forms:** Sheets (1,000×500mm, 35-55 kg, bundle 500-1,000 kg pallets), or remelt to ingots (25-50 kg, standard LME shape 300×150×50mm). Stamp: brand, purity, lot number, LME registered brand if applicable.

**Step 181-195: Electrolyte Management, Byproducts, and Market**

**Electrolyte maintenance:** Tin concentration Sn²⁺: maintain 12-20 g/L (balance anodic dissolution + cathodic plating, adjust by current control or bleed/add). Acid concentration: H₂SiF₆ 100-150 g/L, H₂SO₄ 50-80 g/L (stable, minimal evaporation at 35-40°C, makeup for dragout losses). pH: 0.5-1.5 (strongly acidic, stabilize Sn²⁺). Impurity buildup: Pb, Sb, As accumulate over time (from anode dissolution, not fully plated). Bleed electrolyte: 5-15% per week, treat in chemical plant (precipitate metals as sulfides/hydroxides, recover tin, neutralize acid, discharge). Circulation: pumps circulate electrolyte 1-3 L/min per cell (uniform concentration, remove anode slime suspension, cool/heat exchange). Filtration: cartridge filters or plate-and-frame press (remove slime fines <10 µm, prevent cathode contamination). **Anode slime:** Collect from cell bottom (vacuum system, or drain cells periodically), filter, wash, dry. Composition: 20-50% Sn, 5-20% Cu, 2-10% Pb, 3-8% Sb, 1-5% As, 0.5-3% Bi, 0.01-0.1% Ag (varies by crude tin source). Processing: leach Sn with HCl (SnCl₂), precipitate other metals as hydroxides or sulfides, recover copper (electrolysis or cementation). Value: $50-300 per tonne refined tin (depends on Cu/Ag content, offsets refining costs 3-15%). **Energy consumption:** Electrorefining 280-450 kWh/tonne Sn (DC power 200-350 kWh, heating/pumping 80-100 kWh). Total tin production: mining/concentration 100-200 kWh, smelting 200-400 kWh (thermal equivalent), refining 300-500 kWh, total 600-1,100 kWh/tonne. **Economics:** Operating cost $12,000-18,000/tonne refined tin (ore/concentrate $8,000-12,000, energy $800-1,500, labor/overhead $1,500-2,500, refining chemicals $500-1,000, capex amortization $1,200-2,000). Tin price: $20,000-35,000/tonne (London Metal Exchange LME, volatile 2010-2024, recent $25,000-30,000). Margin: $7,000-18,000/tonne (high-cost miners breakeven $15,000-18,000, low-cost alluvial $8,000-12,000). **Applications breakdown:** Solder 50% (SAC305 96.5Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu, SAC405, SnCu, SnAgBi alloys, lead-free mandate RoHS 2006 increased tin intensity 40% per joint), tinplate 20% (food/beverage cans, 1-10 µm electroplated coating on steel, corrosion resistance), chemicals 15% (organotin PVC heat stabilizers, biocides, catalysts), bronze/bearings 10% (90Cu-10Sn gun metal, 80Cu-10Sn-10Pb bearing bronze), float glass 2% (molten tin bath for flat glass production, 5,000-10,000 tonnes bath recirculated), superconductors 1% (Nb₃Sn superconducting wire), pewter/other 2%. **Recycling:** 30-35% of supply (solder dross from wave soldering, tinplate scrap, tin-bearing alloy scrap). Recycled tin identical to primary, lower energy (skip mining/concentration, direct smelt scrap). **Environmental:** Artisanal mining deforestation (Southeast Asia, clearing rainforest for placer pits, river sedimentation, mercury use in some areas for gold byproduct). Offshore dredging (Indonesia Bangka Strait, 30% of production, seafloor disturbance, coral reef damage, fishing impacts). Smelter emissions: CO, SO₂ (if sulfidic impurities), particulates (arsenic, lead, tin oxide dust, require baghouses/scrubbers). Tailings: gravity concentration 70-90% mass to tailings, low toxicity (cassiterite, quartz, silicates inert, but volume large). Regulations: Conflict minerals (tin from Myanmar, DRC - Dodd-Frank Act Section 1502, EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, require supply chain due diligence, smelter audits RMI/CFSP). RoHS compliance: lead-free solder standard, tin purity critical (Pb <0.1% total product, typically <0.01% in virgin tin, recycled tin risk of lead contamination).

Tin metal production integrates gravity concentration (exploiting cassiterite's exceptional 6.8-7.1 g/cm³ density), carbothermic smelting (simple SnO₂ reduction, lower temperature than copper/iron), and electrorefining (achieve 99.95-99.99% for electronics). Price $25/kg represents refined tin metal for solder alloy production (actual LME $25-30/kg current). Critical for electronics supply chain: lead-free solder transition (2006 RoHS) increased tin demand 35%, modern smartphone uses 0.3-1.2g tin (BGA solder balls, component attach), laptop 2-5g, data center server 15-40g per board. Supply constraints: declining reserves (Myanmar peak production risks, Indonesia environmental restrictions, no major new deposits), substitution difficult (tin's low melting point 232°C, wetting properties, non-toxicity irreplaceable for soldering).
