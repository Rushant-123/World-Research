1. Crude oil delivered to refinery by pipeline or tanker
2. Desalting removes salt and sediment from crude
3. Crude heated to 350-400°C in furnace
4. Atmospheric distillation tower separates by boiling point
5. Gas and naphtha removed at top (<180°C)
6. Kerosene and diesel at middle (180-350°C)
7. Heavy gas oil and residue at bottom (>350°C)
8. Diesel fraction contains C10-C20 hydrocarbons
9. Vacuum distillation for additional diesel recovery
10. Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) removes sulfur
11. Hydrogen reacts with sulfur compounds at 350°C, 50 bar
12. Catalyst: cobalt-molybdenum on alumina
13. Sulfur reduced to <10 ppm (ultra-low sulfur diesel)
14. Hydrogen sulfide removed and sent to Claus unit
15. Hydrotreating improves cetane number
16. Cetane number target: 45-55
17. Cold flow improver additives prevent waxing
18. Pour point depressants for winter operation
19. Detergent additives keep injectors clean
20. Lubricity improvers protect fuel pumps
21. Antioxidants prevent gum formation
22. Biocide prevents microbial growth in tanks
23. Dye added for tax identification (red for off-road)
24. Quality testing for density, viscosity, flash point
25. Distillation profile verified (T90 <350°C)
26. Water and sediment <200 ppm
27. Storage in above-ground or underground tanks
28. Nitrogen blanketing prevents oxidation
29. Loading rack fills tanker trucks
30. Vapor recovery system captures fumes
31. Distribution to retail stations or industrial users
32. Energy density: 35.8 MJ/L
33. Typical consumption: Heavy equipment uses 20-50 L/hour
