Thermoset polymer encapsulating semiconductor chips in packages. Protects from moisture, mechanical stress, contamination. Requirements: low stress (CTE matched to silicon), high purity (no ionic contaminants), flame retardant, moldable. Formulation: epoxy resin + filler + additives.

**Step 1-10: [Epoxy Resin](epoxy-resin) Selection**
Base resin: ortho-cresol novolac epoxy (OCNFE) or biphenyl epoxy. OCNFE most common: epoxy equivalent weight 200-220 g/eq, viscosity 10-30 Pa·s at 150°C. Multifunctional epoxy (4-8 epoxide groups per molecule) for high crosslink density - improves thermal stability, reduces moisture absorption. Solid at room temperature (melts at 80-100°C). Purify resin by filtration through 10 µm filter (remove particles, gel fragments). Test ion content: Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻ each <10 ppm (ionic contamination causes chip corrosion). Store in moisture-proof containers - epoxy absorbs water, reduces shelf life.

**Step 11-22: [Silica Filler](fused-silica) Preparation**
Filler: 70-90% by weight of compound (determines properties). Fused silica (amorphous SiO₂) preferred: CTE 0.55 ppm/°C (close to silicon 2.6 ppm/°C, reduces package stress), low dielectric constant (3.8 at 1 MHz), high purity. Particle size distribution: bimodal (mix of 1-5 µm and 10-30 µm particles, maximizes packing density). Grind silica in ball mill with alumina grinding media (avoid iron contamination). Classify by air separation or sedimentation. Spherical silica preferred (better flow than angular) - make by flame fusion (SiCl₄ + O₂ → SiO₂, spherical droplets solidify). Surface treat silica with silane coupling agent (3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 0.5-2% by weight of silica) - improves adhesion to epoxy matrix, reduces moisture absorption. Heat silica to 120°C for 2 hours to drive off moisture before mixing.

**Step 23-38: [Hardener](curing-agent) and Additive Selection**
Hardener (curing agent): phenol novolac resin (equivalent weight 100-110 g/eq) or dicyandiamide. Mix ratio: 0.8-1.0 epoxy groups per OH group (stoichiometric). Accelerator: 2-methylimidazole or triphenylphosphine (0.1-0.5% by weight) - reduces cure temperature and time. Flame retardant: antimony trioxide (Sb₂O₃, 1-3%) + brominated epoxy resin (2-5%). Alternative: red phosphorus (3-5%) or aluminum hydroxide (30-50% for halogen-free). [Release agent](mold-release): carnauba wax or stearic acid (0.5-2%) - prevents sticking to mold. [Pigment](pigment): carbon black (2-5%) for black appearance (standard), or titanium dioxide for white. Stress control agent: silicone fluid (0.1-1%) - lowers modulus, improves flexibility.

**Step 39-55: Dry Blending**
Weigh ingredients precisely: 15% epoxy resin, 5% hardener, 0.5% accelerator, 2% flame retardant, 1% release agent, 2% carbon black, 74.5% silica filler. Mix dry powders first (filler, flame retardant, pigment) in ribbon blender or V-blender for 15-30 minutes (uniform distribution). Blend under controlled humidity (<40% RH) to prevent moisture pickup. Sieve blend through 1mm screen to break up agglomerates. For low ionic content: use ultra-pure ingredients (electronics grade), stainless steel or PTFE-coated mixing equipment (avoid metal contamination). Target purity: total ionics <50 ppm, moisture <0.05%.

**Step 56-72: Melt Mixing in [Kneader](kneader)**
Transfer dry blend to high-shear kneader (batch mixer with twin contra-rotating Z-blades). Heat jacket to 100-120°C - melts epoxy and hardener resins (liquid phase). Mix at 30-60 rpm for 30-60 minutes. Resin coats filler particles (wetting), releases trapped air. Vacuum can be applied (reduces void content). Monitor temperature - exothermic reaction begins slowly (pre-cure). Keep below 120°C to prevent premature cure (gel point). Monitor viscosity by torque measurement - increases as mixing progresses. Discharge when viscosity reaches target (20,000-50,000 cP at 120°C). Knead forms cohesive dough-like mass.

**Step 73-88: Extrusion and Calendering**
Transfer hot mix to two-roll mill (calender): two heated rollers (120-140°C) rotating at different speeds (1.1-1.3 speed ratio). Material forms band on slower roll. Shear between rolls breaks up agglomerates, improves dispersion. Pass through mill 5-10 times (folding and re-rolling). Thickness: 3-5mm. Alternative: [twin-screw extruder](twin-screw-extruder) (continuous process). Extruder barrel: 30-50mm diameter, L/D ratio 20-40, 8-10 heating zones (80°C to 120°C profile). Twin screws intermesh, convey and mix compound. Extrude through die as ribbon or rod. Water cooling bath immediately after die (quenches, prevents cure advancement).

**Step 89-102: Pelletizing and Grinding**
Cut extruded ribbon into pellets using rotary [cutter](cutting-equipment) or strand pelletizer. Pellet size: 3-8mm granules. Alternatively, grind calendered sheet: break into chunks, feed to granulator (rotating knives + screen). Grind to 3-8mm particles. Pulverize further in hammer mill if finer powder needed. Classify by sieving - reject oversize and undersize (recycle). Cool pellets to room temperature before packaging (prevent clumping). Pellets are solid at room temperature (glass transition temperature Tg = 60-80°C before cure). Package in moisture-barrier bags (aluminum foil laminate) with desiccant. Heat seal bags. Store at 20-25°C. Shelf life: 6-12 months at 25°C, 12-24 months at 5°C (refrigerated).

**Step 103-115: Quality Control Testing**
Spiral flow test: measure melt flow length in spiral mold at molding conditions (175°C, 7 MPa, 90 seconds). Typical: 80-150 cm flow length. Cure characteristics: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) - measure onset temperature (120-140°C), peak temperature (160-180°C), heat of reaction (350-450 J/g). Gel time: measure time to solidification at 175°C (typically 30-60 seconds). Glass transition temperature (Tg): measure by DSC or dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Cured compound: Tg = 160-180°C. Coefficient of thermal expansion: 15-25 ppm/°C below Tg, 50-80 ppm/°C above Tg. Flexural modulus: 15-25 GPa. Water absorption: <0.2% (24 hours at 85°C/85% RH).

**Step 116-128: Molding Process (Transfer Molding)**
At package assembly facility, transfer molding encapsulates chips. Preheat pellets to 80-100°C (softens). Load into transfer pot of molding press. Substrate with die and wire bonds in mold cavity (lower mold half, heated to 175-180°C). Close mold (upper half, heated), apply pressure (5-10 MPa). Plunger pushes softened compound through runners and gates into cavities (fills around chip, wires). Fill time: 2-5 seconds. Hold pressure for 90-120 seconds (curing). Compound crosslinks (thermosetting), solidifies. Mold temperature above Tg (ensures complete cure). Eject molded package. Flash (excess material) on parting line - remove by deflashing. Post-mold cure: bake at 175°C for 4-8 hours (completes cure, reduces stress).

**Step 129-140: Performance Characteristics**
Cured compound properties: density 1.8-2.0 g/cm³ (70-80% filler). Thermal conductivity: 0.6-1.2 W/m·K (depends on filler content). Dielectric constant: 3.5-4.5 at 1 MHz. Volume resistivity: >10¹⁴ Ω·cm. Moisture resistance: JEDEC Level 1 or 2 (withstands 260°C reflow soldering after moisture preconditioning). Adhesion to copper leadframe: >5 MPa (die shear test). Flame rating: UL94 V-0 (self-extinguishing, no flaming drips). Halogen-free formulations available (eliminates Br, Cl, Sb for environmental compliance). Green compounds: Tg >150°C, CTE <20 ppm/°C, low ion content (<10 ppm Cl⁻). Price: $10-30/kg depending on purity and filler loading. Global production: ~500,000 tonnes/year.
