Silicone-coated paper (also called release paper or release liner) is a specialty substrate with a controlled silicone release coating applied to one or both sides. This product serves as a protective backing for pressure-sensitive adhesives in labels, tapes, medical products, and graphics applications, as well as a non-stick surface for baking and industrial processes. The silicone coating provides precise release characteristics while the paper base offers dimensional stability, printability, and cost-effectiveness compared to film alternatives.
