# How to Make a Power Plant

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Utilities](/companies/utilities)
- [Energy Companies](/companies/energy-companies)



Facility converting fuel energy to electrical energy. Types: coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind. [Turbine Generator](turbine-generator) converts mechanical rotation to electricity. Thermal plants use [Boiler](industrial-boiler) to create steam from [Fuel](fuel-source). Steam spins turbine. [Cooling Water](cooling-water-system) condenses steam. [Transformers](power-transformer) step up voltage for transmission.

**Coal Plant:** Burns coal → boils water → steam spins turbine → generator produces 500-1500 MW. Efficiency: 33-40%. CO₂ emissions: 900-1000 g/kWh.

**Natural Gas Combined Cycle:** Gas turbine (like jet engine) + steam turbine using waste heat. Efficiency: 50-60%. Emissions: 400-450 g/kWh.

**Nuclear:** Uranium fission heats water → steam → turbine. No CO₂. 1000-1600 MW per reactor.

**Hydro:** Water falls through turbine. Clean, renewable. 100-22,000 MW (Three Gorges Dam).

**Solar:** Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly. 1-2000 MW farms. Intermittent.

**Wind:** Wind spins blades → generator. 2-15 MW per turbine. Intermittent.
