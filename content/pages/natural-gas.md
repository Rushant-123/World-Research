Fossil fuel - mostly methane (CH₄, 70-95%), with ethane, propane, butane, CO₂, N₂, H₂S. Primary energy source: heating, electricity generation, chemical feedstock (ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, plastics). Global production: 4,100 billion cubic meters/year (2023). Cleanest fossil fuel: 50-60% less CO₂ than coal per unit energy.

**Step 1-15: Geological Formation and Exploration**
Natural gas forms from organic matter (plankton, algae) deposited in sedimentary basins 100-400 million years ago. Buried under sediments (2-5 km depth), heat (60-150°C) and pressure (200-500 bar) crack organic molecules (kerogen) into hydrocarbons. Thermogenic gas: biogenic degradation → kerogen → oil → wet gas (C₁-C₅) → dry gas (mostly CH₄). Deeper/hotter zones → drier gas. Trapped in reservoir rocks: sandstone (porosity 15-35%, permeability 10-1,000 millidarcies) or carbonate (limestone, dolomite). Cap rock: impermeable shale or salt seals trap, prevents gas escape. Exploration: seismic surveys (reflect sound waves off rock layers, map subsurface structure, identify anticlines, faults, stratigraphic traps). 3D seismic: 10-50 km² surveys, resolution 20-50m. Identify prospects (potential reservoirs). Wildcat drilling: exploratory well to test, 1 in 5-10 wells successful (commercial gas). Core samples, wireline logs (gamma ray, resistivity, neutron-density) characterize reservoir.

**Step 16-32: [Drilling](oil-gas-drilling) and Well Completion**
Rotary drilling rig: derrick 40-60m tall, rotary table spins drill string (thousands of meters of steel pipe), drill bit at bottom cuts rock. Onshore rig: land-based, truck-mobile or modular. Offshore rig: jack-up (legs stand on seabed, 50-150m water), semi-submersible (floats, anchored, 200-3,000m water), drillship (dynamic positioning, 3,000m+ ultra-deep). Drill vertically to 500-2,000m, then kick off (directional drilling, steer bit with mud motors or rotary steerable systems). Horizontal drilling: turn 90°, drill 1-3 km horizontally through pay zone (maximizes contact with reservoir). Drill bit: tricone (three rotating cones with teeth/carbide inserts) or PDC (polycrystalline diamond compact, fixed cutters). Penetration rate: 10-50 m/hour in soft rock, 3-15 m/hour in hard. Drilling mud: bentonite clay + water + additives, circulates down drill string, returns up annulus carrying cuttings. Mud weight: 1.0-2.2 g/cm³ (hydrostatic pressure prevents blowout). Total depth: 2,000-6,000m typical, 8,000-12,000m for deep wells. Drilling time: 30-90 days.

**Step 33-50: Casing, Cementing, and Perforation**
Install casing: steel pipe 10-30 cm diameter, cemented into wellbore (isolates formations, prevents collapse, controls pressure). Casing program: conductor (0-50m, 30-80 cm), surface casing (0-500m, 25-40 cm), intermediate casing (0-3,000m, 20-30 cm), production casing (total depth, 15-25 cm). Lower casing, pump cement slurry (Portland cement + water + additives) down casing, up annulus to surface. Wait on cement: 12-48 hours (cures, compressive strength >10 MPa). Cement bond log: verify cement quality. Perforate production zone: wireline gun with shaped charges (explosive jets) punches holes through casing and cement into reservoir (10-30 holes/meter, 0.5-1.5 cm diameter). Formation fluid (gas, oil, water) flows through perforations into wellbore.

**Step 51-68: Hydraulic Fracturing (Unconventional Gas)**
Conventional reservoirs: high permeability (>10 millidarcies), gas flows naturally. Unconventional: shale gas (very low permeability <0.001 millidarcies, trapped in micropores), tight gas, coal bed methane. Require hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to produce economically. Frack procedure: isolate zone with packers, pump fracturing fluid (water 90%, proppant 9% - sand or ceramic beads, chemicals 1% - friction reducers, biocides, surfactants) at high pressure (400-800 bar) and high rate (5-15 m³/min). Pressure exceeds rock strength (30-60 MPa), creates fractures (cracks) propagating 50-300m into formation. Pump proppant-laden fluid, proppant enters fractures. Shut in, release pressure, fractures try to close but propped open by sand grains. Creates conductive pathway (fracture permeability >1,000 darcy-ft, 6-10 orders of magnitude higher than matrix). Flowback: return 20-50% of frac fluid over 2-4 weeks (dispose or recycle). Gas production: 5,000-50,000 m³/day per well initially (decline 50-80% in first year, long tail production). Multi-stage fracking: fracture 10-40 stages along horizontal well (total 100-300 tonnes proppant, 10,000-20,000 m³ water per well).

**Step 69-85: Gas Production and Gathering**
Wellhead: Christmas tree (assembly of valves, pressure gauges) controls flow, measures pressure (initial 200-500 bar, declines over time). Production tubing: 6-10 cm diameter pipe inside production casing, gas flows up tubing. Separator: three-phase separator near wellhead splits gas, oil (if present), water. Gas exits top, oil middle, water bottom. Dehydration: remove water vapor (prevents hydrate formation, corrosion). Glycol dehydration: gas contacts triethylene glycol (TEG) in contactor tower, TEG absorbs water, dry gas exits (dew point <-40°C). Regenerate TEG by heating to 200°C, drive off water, recirculate. Field gathering system: flowlines (5-15 cm diameter pipelines) collect gas from multiple wells to central facility. Compression: boost pressure to 50-100 bar for transmission. Reciprocating or centrifugal compressors, driven by gas engines or electric motors.

**Step 86-103: [Gas Processing](gas-processing) Plant**
Raw gas composition varies: CH₄ 70-95%, C₂H₆ (ethane) 5-15%, C₃H₈ (propane) 2-5%, C₄H₁₀ (butane) 1-2%, C₅⁺ (pentanes+) 0.5-2%, CO₂ 1-10%, N₂ 1-15%, H₂S 0-30% (sour gas). Processing objectives: remove impurities (CO₂, H₂S, water), extract NGLs (natural gas liquids - ethane, propane, butane, pentanes), deliver pipeline-spec gas. **Acid gas removal:** amine treating for CO₂ and H₂S. Absorber tower: gas flows up, lean amine (MEA or MDEA solution) flows down, absorbs acid gases. Rich amine to regenerator (stripper), heated to 100-120°C, releases CO₂ and H₂S. H₂S to Claus plant (sulfur recovery): 2H₂S + 3O₂ → 2SO₂ + 2H₂O, then 2H₂S + SO₂ → 3S + 2H₂O. Elemental sulfur (bright yellow solid) sold (fertilizer, chemicals). **NGL extraction:** cryogenic process, cool gas to -90°C to -150°C (turbo-expander cools via adiabatic expansion). Heavier hydrocarbons (C₂-C₅) condense, separate in demethanizer column. Methane vapor exits top (pipeline gas), NGLs exit bottom. **Fractionation:** separate NGLs into components. De-ethanizer (ethane overhead), depropanizer (propane), debutanizer (butane). Each product stored separately.

**Step 104-120: Pipeline [Transmission](gas-pipeline)**
Long-distance pipelines: 60-150 cm diameter, steel pipe (X60-X80 grade, 10-25mm wall thickness), operating pressure 50-100 bar. Coating: fusion-bonded epoxy (FBE, 300-500 µm) or 3-layer polyethylene (prevents corrosion). Cathodic protection: impressed current or sacrificial anodes (prevent external corrosion). Welding: automatic or semi-automatic, X-ray inspected (100% weld inspection). Hydrostatic testing: fill with water, pressurize to 1.5× operating pressure, hold 4-8 hours (verify integrity). Bury 1-2 meters underground. Compressor stations: every 100-200 km, boost pressure (15-20 bar pressure drop per 100 km due to friction). Centrifugal compressors: 5-30 MW per station, driven by gas turbines (aero-derivative or industrial). Pipeline capacity: 1-30 billion m³/year depending on diameter and pressure. Major pipelines: Nord Stream (Russia-Germany, 1,224 km offshore), Trans-Alaska (1,288 km), Central Asia-China (multiple lines, 10,000+ km total).

**Step 121-135: LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) for Long-Distance Transport**
Gas liquefies at -162°C (at atmospheric pressure). LNG: refrigerate gas to -162°C, volume reduces 600× (liquid is 420 kg/m³ vs gas 0.7 kg/m³ at 1 atm). Liquefaction plant: multi-stage refrigeration. Pre-cool with propane to -40°C, then ethylene to -100°C, then mixed refrigerant (methane-ethane-propane-nitrogen) to -162°C. Power consumption: 200-400 kWh/tonne LNG (10-15% of energy content). Capacity: 5-10 million tonnes/year per train. Largest plants: Qatargas (77 Mt/year total), Gorgon Australia (15.6 Mt/year). LNG storage: double-wall cryogenic tanks, 50,000-200,000 m³ capacity, inner wall 9% nickel steel or aluminum (ductile at -162°C), outer wall concrete or carbon steel, insulation (perlite or polyurethane foam). Boil-off gas: 0.05-0.15%/day (re-liquefy or use as fuel). Shipping: LNG carriers, 125,000-265,000 m³ capacity, spherical (Moss design) or membrane tanks. 7-21 day voyages. Regasification terminal: vaporize LNG by seawater heat exchangers or submerged combustion vaporizers, send to pipeline at 50-80 bar. LNG trade: 540 billion m³/year (13% of global gas, growing rapidly). Major exporters: Qatar, Australia, USA. Major importers: Japan, China, South Korea, Europe.

**Step 136-148: Gas-to-Power and Industrial Uses**
**Electricity generation:** combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT). Gas turbine (Bragg cycle): compress air to 20-30 bar, mix with gas, combust at 1,400-1,600°C, expand through turbine (drives generator). Exhaust 500-650°C feeds heat recovery steam generator (HRSG, makes steam). Steam turbine (Rankine cycle, secondary generator). Combined efficiency: 55-63% (higher heating value basis) vs coal 35-45%, nuclear 33%. Load following: ramp 10-30 MW/min (flexible, complements renewables). **Industrial heat:** furnaces, boilers, kilns, dryers. Direct combustion 1,000-2,000°C flames (glass, steel, ceramics). Process heaters: chemical plants (steam reforming for hydrogen, ethylene crackers). **Chemical feedstock:** Steam reforming: CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂ (make hydrogen for ammonia, refining). Methanol synthesis: CO + 2H₂ → CH₃OH (feedstock for formaldehyde, acetic acid, MTBE, plastics). Ethylene crackers: thermal cracking of ethane → ethylene (polyethylene production). Carbon black: partial combustion → soot (rubber reinforcement, pigment).

**Step 149-160: Environmental and Climate Considerations**
**CO₂ emissions:** Natural gas combustion: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + heat. Carbon content: 15.3 kg C/GJ (vs coal 25-28 kg C/GJ, oil 19-21 kg C/GJ). CO₂ emissions: 56 kg CO₂/GJ (coal 95 kg/GJ, oil 73 kg/GJ). Switching coal→gas power reduces emissions ~50%. **Methane leakage:** CH₄ is potent greenhouse gas (GWP100 = 28-30× CO₂). Leaks from wells, pipelines, compressors, processing plants. Estimated 1-3% of production leaks (if >3%, climate benefit vs coal eliminated over 20-year timeframe). Mitigation: replace pneumatic controllers (bleed gas continuously) with electric, leak detection and repair (LDAR programs, infrared cameras), vapor recovery units. **Flaring:** burn associated gas at oil wells (if no pipeline or market). Global flaring: 140 billion m³/year (3.5% of production, wasteful, CO₂ emissions). Reduce by gas-to-power, gas-to-liquids, or re-inject. **Water use:** fracking uses 10,000-20,000 m³ per well. Flowback water: saline (30,000-200,000 ppm TDS), contains fracturing chemicals, naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM - radium). Dispose in injection wells or treat and reuse. Surface spills, groundwater contamination concerns (regulatory oversight varies).

**Step 161-170: Reserves, Production, and Economics**
Proven reserves: 188 trillion cubic meters (tcm) (2023). R/P ratio: 46 years at current consumption. Top reserves: Russia 48 tcm (26% of world), Iran 32 tcm (17%), Qatar 25 tcm (13%), Turkmenistan 14 tcm, USA 13 tcm, China 8 tcm. Production 2023: 4,100 bcm. Top producers: USA 1,030 bcm (25%, shale revolution made USA top producer 2013), Russia 700 bcm (17%), Iran 260 bcm, China 230 bcm, Qatar 180 bcm, Canada 180 bcm. Unconventional gas: 40% of US production (Marcellus, Permian, Haynesville shale plays). Price volatility: Henry Hub (US benchmark) $2-15/MMBtu (2010-2024), Europe (TTF) $5-50/MMBtu (extreme volatility post-Ukraine invasion 2022). Breakeven costs: conventional $1-3/MMBtu, shale $2-5/MMBtu, LNG landed $8-15/MMBtu (including liquefaction $3-5, shipping $1-2, regasification $0.5-1). Stranded gas: remote reserves (Arctic, offshore, Africa) require LNG export ($10-20B plants) or pipeline to market.

**Step 171-180: Energy Transition Role**
"Bridge fuel" debate: Gas emits less CO₂ than coal, but still fossil fuel. Scenarios: (1) Gas demand peaks 2030-2040, declines as renewables + storage + electrification displace (IEA Net Zero scenario). (2) Gas demand grows to 2050, replaces coal, backstops intermittent renewables (OPEC scenario). Hydrogen: steam methane reforming produces 95% of hydrogen today (gray hydrogen, 10 kg CO₂/kg H₂). Blue hydrogen: SMR + CCS, captures 85-95% of CO₂ (cost $2-4/kg H₂ vs green hydrogen electrolysis $5-10/kg). Green hydrogen: electrolyze water with renewable electricity (zero carbon, but expensive). Renewable natural gas (RNG): biogas from landfills, wastewater treatment, anaerobic digesters (dairy manure, food waste) upgraded to pipeline quality (99% CH₄). Carbon-negative if displaces methane emissions. Production: 3 bcm/year globally (0.1% of gas, potential 100-200 bcm/year from all biomass waste). Synthetic methane: Sabatier reaction (CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O), use green H₂ + captured CO₂, carbon-neutral fuel. Pilot projects, not commercial.

Price: $0.12/kg represents normalized natural gas cost for industrial use. Actual pricing: $3-15/MMBtu = $0.10-0.50/kg depending on market (1 MMBtu ≈ 26.4 kg methane, $3/MMBtu = $0.11/kg, $15/MMBtu = $0.57/kg). Used extensively across supply chain: electricity generation for fabs and data centers, hydrogen production (steam reforming for semiconductors), ammonia synthesis (Haber-Bosch), process heat (glass, metals, ceramics), chemical feedstocks (plastics, epoxy precursors). Per chip allocation: electricity consumed during chip manufacturing ~100-300 kWh (if 50% gas-fired generation, 50-150 kWh from gas → 20-50 kg gas @ 35% efficiency → $2-8 of gas per chip). The $0.12 represents commodity input cost per kg in supply chain model.
