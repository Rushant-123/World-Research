1. Receive high-purity silver metal shot or granules (99.9% Ag minimum)

2. Weigh silver metal in required quantity using precision balance (±0.01g accuracy)

3. Transfer silver to glass-lined reactor vessel equipped with mechanical stirrer

4. Add deionized water to reactor creating silver suspension

5. Prepare dilute nitric acid solution (30-50% HNO₃) by diluting concentrated 68% acid

6. Slowly add nitric acid to silver suspension under controlled conditions

7. Initiate dissolution reaction: 3Ag + 4HNO₃ → 3AgNO₃ + NO + 2H₂O

8. Control exothermic reaction maintaining temperature at 40-60°C using cooling jacket

9. Stir reaction mixture continuously ensuring complete dissolution of silver

10. Observe brown nitrogen dioxide gas evolution indicating ongoing reaction

11. Vent NOx gases through scrubber system neutralizing with caustic solution

12. Continue acid addition until all metallic silver dissolves completely (2-6 hours)

13. Monitor pH of solution reaching approximately pH 0-1 indicating excess acid

14. Heat solution to 80-90°C driving off excess NOx gases and unreacted nitric acid

15. Filter hot solution through sintered glass filter removing any undissolved residues

16. Concentrate filtrate by controlled evaporation under vacuum reducing volume

17. Cool concentrated solution slowly inducing crystallization of silver nitrate

18. Maintain cooling at 5-10°C/hour allowing formation of large crystals

19. Observe white needle-like or rhombohedral silver nitrate crystals forming

20. Separate crystals from mother liquor using vacuum filtration or centrifuge

21. Wash crystals with small portions of ice-cold deionized water removing impurities

22. Recrystallize product from hot water if high purity required (>99.9%)

23. Dry crystals in vacuum oven at 60-80°C for 12-24 hours

24. Grind dried silver nitrate to uniform particle size using mortar or mill

25. Analyze product purity by argentometric titration or ICP-OES

26. Verify silver content should be 63.5% by mass (stoichiometric AgNO₃)

27. Test for common impurities (chloride, sulfate, copper, lead) by wet chemistry

28. Package silver nitrate in amber glass bottles protecting from light

29. Label containers with hazard warnings (corrosive, oxidizer, light-sensitive)

30. Store in cool, dark, dry location away from organic materials and reducing agents

31. Generate certificate of analysis documenting purity and trace element content

32. Ship silver nitrate as hazardous material (UN1493, Class 5.1 oxidizer)

33. Silver nitrate used in photography (light-sensitive emulsions), analytical chemistry (chloride titration), silver plating, electronics (conductive inks), medical applications (antiseptic, cauterization), and chemical synthesis as silver source
