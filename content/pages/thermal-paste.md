# How to Make Thermal Paste

Thermal interface material (TIM) that fills microscopic air gaps between CPU/GPU and heatsink. Typical thermal conductivity: 3-12 W/m·K. Applied in thin layer (0.05-0.1mm) to improve heat transfer. Remains pliable over wide temperature range (-50°C to 150°C).

## What is it?

Paste-like compound of silicone polymer matrix filled with thermally conductive particles (zinc oxide, aluminum oxide, silver, or diamond powder). Consistency similar to toothpaste. Fills surface imperfections that would otherwise trap insulating air. Non-curing type remains pliable. Curing type solidifies after application (used in factory assembly).

## Steps to Make (simplified):
1. Mix [Silicone Base](silicone-polymer) with [Thermal Filler](metal-oxide-powder) in precise ratios
2. High-end: 60-80% filler loading by weight
3. Use three-roll mill or planetary mixer to disperse particles uniformly
4. Degas under vacuum to remove air bubbles
5. Test thermal conductivity and viscosity
6. Fill into [Syringe Tube](syringe-tube) or tube packaging
7. Quality control: test conductivity, pump-out resistance, stability
