# How to Make a Cleanroom Facility

**Top Market Leaders:**

A cleanroom is a controlled environment where airborne particles, temperature, humidity, and pressure are regulated to precise levels. Essential for semiconductor manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and precision manufacturing where even microscopic contamination causes defects.

## What is it?

A room with controlled air quality measured by particles per cubic meter. Classifications range from ISO Class 1 (cleanest, <10 particles ≥0.1μm per m³) to ISO Class 9 (>35 million particles per m³). Semiconductor fabs use ISO Class 1-5. HEPA-filtered air flows continuously, workers wear full bunny suits, and materials enter through pass-through chambers.

## Steps to Make:

**Design Phase:**
1. Determine cleanliness class required (ISO 1-9)
2. Calculate air changes per hour (ACH): ISO 1-3 needs 300-600 ACH
3. Design airflow pattern: laminar (unidirectional) or turbulent
4. Plan layout: gowning areas, airlocks, process areas, storage
5. Calculate HEPA filter coverage (% of ceiling)
6. Design utilities: power, gases, DI water, process chemicals
7. Plan vibration isolation (critical for precision equipment)
8. Design static control (ESD protection)

**Site Preparation:**
2. Start with existing [Building Structure](industrial-building) or construct new
3. Building must have: structural support for equipment, adequate power, water, HVAC capacity
4. Isolate cleanroom area from rest of building
5. Install vibration-isolated foundation if needed
6. Seal all penetrations (pipes, conduits) in floor/walls

**Raised Floor Installation:**
7. Install [Raised Floor System](raised-flooring) 600-900mm above structural floor
8. Raised floor supported on adjustable pedestals (grid of 600mm × 600mm)
9. Floor panels: aluminum or steel with vinyl or epoxy coating
10. Raised floor provides space for: return air plenum, utilities, cables
11. Perforated floor panels in specific areas for air return
12. Floor must be grounded to prevent static buildup

**Wall and Ceiling Framework:**
13. Install aluminum framing system around perimeter
14. Frame must be rigid and vibration-free
15. Install [Ceiling Grid](suspended-ceiling) suspended from structural ceiling
16. Ceiling grid supports: HEPA filter modules, lighting, utilities
17. Grid spacing: typically 600mm or 1,200mm modules

**Wall Panel Installation:**
18. Install [Wall Panels](cleanroom-panels) in aluminum frames
19. Panels made of: aluminum skin with honeycomb or foam core
20. Smooth, non-porous surface - easy to clean, doesn't shed particles
21. Panels interlock with gaskets for airtight seals
22. Windows: double-pane polycarbonate or acrylic, flush-mounted
23. All corners rounded (no sharp edges to trap particles)

**HEPA Filter Installation:**
24. Install [HEPA Filters](hepa-filters) in ceiling grid
25. HEPA = High Efficiency Particulate Air filter
26. Removes ≥99.97% of particles ≥0.3 microns
27. ULPA (Ultra-Low Penetration Air) for ISO 1-3: removes ≥99.9995% of particles
28. Filter dimensions: 600mm × 600mm or 1,200mm × 600mm
29. Gel-seal filters into frames for perfect seal
30. For ISO 3 cleanroom: 80-100% of ceiling is HEPA filters
31. Lower class rooms: 15-40% HEPA ceiling coverage

**Air Handling System:**
32. Install [Air Handling Units](hvac-system) in mechanical room above or beside cleanroom
33. AHU components: pre-filters, cooling coils, heating coils, humidifier, fan
34. Pre-filters (MERV 14-16) remove large particles before HEPA
35. Chilled water coils cool air to 18-22°C
36. Humidifier maintains 40-45% RH (relative humidity)
37. High-pressure fans push air through system
38. Ductwork from AHU to ceiling plenum above HEPA filters
39. Positive pressure in cleanroom (5-20 Pascals higher than adjacent areas)
40. Positive pressure prevents contaminated air from entering

**Airflow Pattern:**
41. For ISO 1-4: vertical laminar flow
42. Air enters from 100% HEPA ceiling
43. Air flows straight down at 0.3-0.5 m/s (uniform velocity)
44. Perforated raised floor panels allow air to exit
45. Air returns through raised floor plenum to AHU
46. This creates unidirectional "piston-like" airflow
47. Particles swept straight down and out
48. For ISO 5-7: turbulent flow with 15-40% HEPA coverage

**Lighting Installation:**
49. Install [LED Lighting](clean-led-lights) flush-mounted in ceiling
50. Lights must be cleanroom-compatible: sealed, no particle shedding
51. LED chosen for: low heat generation, long life, no UV emission
52. Illumination level: 800-1,500 lux at work surface
53. Emergency lighting and exit signs required by code

**Entry System:**
54. Install personnel entry sequence: locker room → gowning room → air shower → cleanroom
55. [Air Shower](air-shower) between gowning and cleanroom
56. Air shower: small chamber with high-velocity air jets (20-30 m/s)
57. Air jets blow particles off gown suit before entering cleanroom
58. 20-30 second cycle
59. Interlocked doors: can't open both simultaneously

**Material Entry:**
60. Install [Pass-Through Chambers](pass-box) in walls
61. Pass-box allows material transfer without opening doors
62. Two doors interlocked (can't open both at once)
63. Interior surfaces stainless steel, easy to clean
64. HEPA filter above pass-box maintains positive pressure
65. UV light inside for sterilization (optional, for biotech)

**Utilities Installation:**
66. Install clean dry air (CDA) system: compressed air filtered through HEPA
67. Install nitrogen, argon, or other process gases with point-of-use filters
68. Install DI (deionized) water system with 18.2 MΩ·cm resistivity
69. Install vacuum system for process tools
70. Install process exhaust for chemical fumes
71. Install ultrapure chemical distribution (acids, solvents)
72. All utility lines: stainless steel or high-purity polymer
73. All connections: orbital welded (no threads to trap particles)

**Electrical System:**
74. Install power distribution: 208V 3-phase, 480V for heavy equipment
75. Install UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for critical equipment
76. Install ESD (electrostatic discharge) grounding: wrist straps, mats, heel grounders
77. Ionizers at workstations to neutralize static charge
78. All outlets ESD-safe (grounded)

**Monitoring System:**
79. Install [Monitoring System](particle-counter) - particle counters throughout room
80. Laser particle counters measure 0.1μm, 0.3μm, 0.5μm, 1μm, 5μm particles
81. Continuous monitoring and data logging
82. Install temperature sensors (target ±0.5°C)
83. Install humidity sensors (target ±2% RH)
84. Install differential pressure sensors at doors
85. Install airflow velocity sensors
86. Central BMS (building management system) monitors all parameters
87. Alarms if any parameter out of specification

**Final Sealing:**
88. Seal all penetrations, joints, seams with cleanroom-grade sealant
89. RTV silicone or polyurethane sealant
90. Must be non-outgassing (won't release particles or VOCs)

**Certification Testing:**
91. Perform HEPA filter leak test
92. Inject aerosol upstream of filters
93. Scan downstream with photometer
94. Any leaks >0.01% require filter replacement or resealing
95. Perform airflow velocity test at multiple points
96. Verify uniform velocity (±20%)
97. Perform particle count test at multiple locations
98. Run for 30 minutes, count particles
99. Must meet ISO classification at all locations
100. Perform air changes per hour test
101. Perform recovery test: introduce particles, measure time to clean
102. Typical recovery: ISO 3 cleanroom cleans 100,000 particles to <100 in 10-20 minutes

**Validation:**
103. Operate cleanroom for 24-48 hours
104. Verify all parameters stable
105. Issue certification report with test results
106. Re-certify every 6-12 months

**Gowning Procedure (for workers):**
107. Remove street clothes, jewelry, cosmetics in locker room
108. Put on cleanroom undergarments if required
109. In gowning room, put on: bouffant cap (covers hair), face mask, safety glasses
110. Put on cleanroom coverall (bunny suit) - full-body garment
111. Put on shoe covers or dedicated cleanroom shoes
112. Put on gloves (nitrile, powder-free, low-particle shedding)
113. For ISO 1-3: add hood, goggles, full face covering
114. Enter air shower, stand still for 20-30 seconds
115. Enter cleanroom

**Cleanroom Rules:**
116. No food, drink, gum, tobacco
117. No cosmetics, perfume, hairspray
118. No paper (sheds fibers) - use cleanroom paper or plastic sheets
119. No pencils (graphite particles) - use ballpoint pens only
120. No cardboard boxes (shed particles) - use plastic totes
121. Move slowly and deliberately - fast movements create turbulence
122. Don't touch face or adjust gown while inside
123. Minimize talking (breath contains particles)

**Maintenance:**
124. Replace HEPA filters every 2-5 years (or when pressure drop increases)
125. Clean surfaces daily with IPA (isopropyl alcohol) and cleanroom wipes

- ISO 7-8: Pharmaceuticals (sterile manufacturing), medical devices, optics
- ISO 9: General electronics assembly

**Costs:**
- Construction: $1,000-4,000 per square foot
- ISO 3-5 (semiconductor): $2,500-4,000/ft²
- ISO 7-8 (pharma): $500-1,500/ft²
- Operating cost: $10-50 per square foot per year
- Energy: cleanrooms consume 50-100× more energy than office space
- Major energy use: HVAC (70-80%), process equipment (15-25%), lighting (5%)

**Size:**
- Typical semiconductor fab: 10,000-50,000 m² cleanroom space
- Biotech facility: 500-5,000 m²

A Class 1 cleanroom (ISO 1) is 1 million times cleaner than typical outdoor air and 10,000 times cleaner than a hospital operating room. Maintaining this level of cleanliness requires constant air filtration, strict protocols, and significant energy input. Even a single human hair (70 microns diameter) is 700× larger than the smallest particles controlled in an ISO 1 cleanroom.
