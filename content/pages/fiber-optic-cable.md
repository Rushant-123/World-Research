High-speed data transmission cable using glass or plastic optical fibers to carry light signals. Modern Macs don't typically include fiber internally, but Thunderbolt cables can use active optical cables (AOC) for long-distance runs (10-50m, 40 Gbps Thunderbolt 3/4). Fiber construction: ultra-pure silica glass core (8-50 µm diameter), cladding (125 µm), protective coatings (acrylate 250 µm), strength members (aramid/Kevlar), outer jacket. Single-mode fiber (SMF, 9 µm core, long-distance 10+ km, laser source) or multi-mode fiber (MMF, 50-62.5 µm core, short-distance <500m, LED/VCSEL source). Advantages over copper: immune to EMI, no ground loops, bandwidth 10-100 Gbps+, lightweight. Global production: 600+ million fiber-km/year.

**Step 1-15: [Silica Glass Preform](silica-glass-preform) Fabrication - Core**
Optical fiber starts as large glass rod (preform, 10-30 cm diameter, 1-3 m long), drawn into thin fiber (125 µm). Preform fabrication by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). **Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition (MCVD):** (1) Substrate: Fused silica tube (synthetic quartz, 99.999% SiO₂, <1 ppm impurities Fe/Cu/OH, 25mm OD × 20mm ID × 1.2m length). Mounted horizontally on glass-working lathe, rotates 60-200 RPM. (2) **Gas delivery:** Inject precursor gases into tube: silicon tetrachloride SiCl₄ (vaporized liquid, carrier gas O₂, flow rate 0.1-1.0 g/min), germanium tetrachloride GeCl₄ (dopant, raises refractive index, 0.01-0.20 g/min for 1-10 mol% GeO₂ in core), boron trichloride BCl₃ or phosphorus oxychloride POCl₃ (optional, fine-tune index profile). (3) **Oxidation and deposition:** Traversing oxy-hydrogen burner (H₂ + O₂ torch, 1,800-2,000°C flame) moves along rotating tube exterior. Inside tube: gases react in hot zone: SiCl₄ + O₂ → SiO₂ + 2Cl₂, GeCl₄ + O₂ → GeO₂ + 2Cl₂. Submicron SiO₂-GeO₂ particles (soot) deposit on inner tube wall, sinter into dense glass layer (10-50 µm per pass). (4) **Layering:** 50-200 passes build up core and inner cladding (500-2,000 layers, each pass slightly different GeO₂ concentration, creates refractive index gradient - higher index core, lower index cladding - step-index or graded-index profile). Total deposition time: 2-6 hours. (5) **Collapse:** After deposition complete, increase burner temperature to 2,200-2,300°C, traverse slowly (tube softens, surface tension collapses tube into solid rod, eliminate central hole). Preform now 10-25mm diameter solid rod, core 1-5mm diameter (core/clad ratio matches final fiber 9/125 µm or 50/125 µm). **Alternative: Outside Vapor Deposition (OVD):** Deposit soot on outside of rotating mandrel (ceramic rod), build up porous preform (30-50 cm diameter soot blank), remove mandrel, sinter in furnace (1,500°C, consolidate to solid glass), drill/etch center hole if needed. OVD produces larger preforms (more fiber per preform, 500-2,000 km vs MCVD 10-50 km).

**Step 16-35: Preform Quality and Refractive Index Profile**
**Refractive index measurement:** Preform analyzer scans laser beam across preform cross-section, measures deflection (refractometer, resolution 0.0001 refractive index units). Plot n(r) refractive index vs radius. **Single-mode fiber target:** Core n₁ = 1.4680 (SiO₂ + 3-5% GeO₂), cladding n₂ = 1.4625 (pure SiO₂), Δn = 0.0055 (0.37% relative index difference). Core diameter 8-9 µm (scales from preform core 2-3mm when drawn down 250×). **Multi-mode fiber:** Core n₁ = 1.490 (8-10% GeO₂), cladding n₂ = 1.4625, Δn = 0.0275 (1.9%). Core diameter 50 µm or 62.5 µm (OM2/OM3/OM4 MMF standards, graded-index parabolic profile minimizes modal dispersion). **Numerical aperture (NA):** NA = √(n₁² – n₂²) ≈ n₁√(2Δ), determines light acceptance angle θ = arcsin(NA). Single-mode NA 0.12-0.14 (small angle, highly directional, long-distance), multi-mode NA 0.20-0.29 (wider angle, easier coupling, LED sources). **Attenuation:** Ultra-pure silica target <0.5 dB/km at 1,310 nm, <0.2 dB/km at 1,550 nm (telecom C-band, lowest loss). Impurity limits: OH (hydroxyl) <1 ppb (absorption peak 1,383 nm, "water peak" historically problematic, modern low-water-peak fiber <0.5 dB/km at 1,383 nm allows use of entire 1,260-1,625 nm spectrum), transition metals Fe/Cu/Cr <10 ppb (UV-visible absorption, scattering). Multi-mode fiber: 3 dB/km at 850 nm (VCSEL source, OM3/OM4 for 10G/40G Ethernet <300m). **Preform inspection:** Bubble scan (ultrasonic or optical, detect inclusions >10 µm, bubbles from incomplete sintering or contamination, causes scattering loss, fiber breakage). Dimensional check (diameter ±0.5mm, length, straightness <1mm/m bow).

**Step 36-58: [Fiber Drawing Tower](optical-fiber-furnace) - High-Temperature Process**
Convert preform into thin fiber. **Draw tower:** Vertical furnace system 10-25 meters tall (multi-story building). (1) **Preform feed:** Mount preform on precision feed mechanism (lowering motor, 1-30 mm/min feed rate). (2) **Furnace:** Graphite resistance furnace or induction furnace, temperature 2,000-2,200°C (above silica softening point 1,585°C, glass becomes viscous, surface tension forms meniscus). Preform tip heated in furnace hot zone (50-100mm length), molten glass neck-down region. (3) **Fiber pulling:** Gravity + capstan pulling force draws fiber downward. Draw speed 10-40 m/s (600-2,400 m/min, high-speed production). Fiber diameter controlled by balance of feed rate vs draw speed: diameter scales as √(feed rate / draw speed). Target 125 µm ±1 µm. (4) **Diameter monitor:** Laser micrometer measures fiber diameter continuously (1-5 meters below furnace, resolution 0.1 µm). Feedback control adjusts draw speed or furnace temperature (servo loop, maintain diameter within ±0.5 µm). (5) **Cooling:** Fiber cools rapidly below furnace (radiative + convective cooling in helium or nitrogen atmosphere, prevents surface crystallization - fiber must quench to amorphous glass state). Cooling rate 1,000-10,000°C/second. (6) **Coating applicator:** 5-10 meters below furnace, fiber passes through liquid [acrylate coating](uv-curable-acrylate) cup (UV-curable polymer, viscosity 500-2,000 cP). Concentric coating die applies 10-30 µm primary coating (soft, cushions fiber, E modulus 0.5-2 MPa), then 15-30 µm secondary coating (hard, abrasion resistant, E 500-1,500 MPa). Total coated diameter 245-250 µm (standard). (7) **UV curing:** Fiber passes through UV lamp array (mercury arc or LED UV 365-405 nm, 1-3 W/cm², 0.5-1.5 second exposure). Acrylate photoinitiators generate free radicals, polymer crosslinks, solidifies. (8) **Proof test:** Apply tensile stress 50-100 kpsi (350-700 MPa, 0.5-1.0% strain) to fiber inline (weak sections break, removed, only high-strength fiber spooled, ensures >700 MPa strength in field, prevents brittle fracture). (9) **Capstan and take-up:** Precision capstan (controlled speed, tension 20-100 grams) pulls fiber, winds onto spool (10-50 km per spool, 30-40 cm diameter bobbin).

**Step 59-78: Fiber Specifications and Testing - Optical Performance**
**Core/cladding diameter:** 9/125 µm (single-mode, SMF-28 standard, ITU-T G.652.D), 50/125 µm (multi-mode OM3/OM4, 10/40/100 Gbps Ethernet), 62.5/125 µm (legacy multi-mode OM1, 1 Gbps). Tolerance: core ±0.5 µm, cladding ±1 µm, concentricity error <0.5 µm (core offset from cladding center causes splice loss). **Attenuation:** OTDR (optical time-domain reflectometer) measures loss vs length. Inject laser pulse (1,310 nm or 1,550 nm, 1-10 ns width), measure backscattered light (Rayleigh scattering, intensity decays exponentially with distance, slope = attenuation coefficient α in dB/km). Single-mode specification: <0.35 dB/km at 1,310 nm, <0.25 dB/km at 1,550 nm (ITU-T G.652). Multi-mode: <3.0 dB/km at 850 nm, <1.0 dB/km at 1,300 nm (OM3/OM4 laser-optimized, OM1/OM2 LED-optimized 3-4 dB/km). **Bandwidth (multi-mode only):** Modal dispersion limits bandwidth-distance product. OM3: 2,000 MHz·km at 850 nm (10 Gbps × 300m, 40 Gbps × 100m). OM4: 4,700 MHz·km at 850 nm (40 Gbps × 150m, 100 Gbps × 100m). Measured by launching short laser pulse, measure pulse spreading (overfilled launch OFL or effective modal bandwidth EMB). **Chromatic dispersion (single-mode):** Wavelength-dependent propagation velocity, limits bit rate × distance. SMF-28: zero-dispersion wavelength λ₀ = 1,310 nm, dispersion D = 17 ps/(nm·km) at 1,550 nm. 10 Gbps NRZ: dispersion limit ~1,000 km uncompensated (pulse broadening <10% bit period). **Polarization mode dispersion (PMD):** Birefringence in fiber (non-circular core, stress) splits two polarization modes, differential delay. Specification: PMD coefficient <0.1 ps/√km (single-mode). Limits 10-40 Gbps long-haul (>500 km).

**Step 79-100: Cable Construction - Strength Members and Jacketing**
Raw fiber fragile (125 µm glass, breaks easily, minimum bend radius 15-30mm to avoid microbending loss). Cable adds mechanical protection. **Tight-buffer cable (indoor):** (1) **Buffer coating:** Extrude thermoplastic buffer over 250 µm coated fiber (PVC, PVDF, or Hytrel polyester elastomer, 900 µm or 2-3mm OD, color-coded). Buffer protects fiber, easy to strip/connectorize. (2) **Strength member:** [Aramid yarn](kevlar-fiber) (Kevlar, Twaron, Technora, 1,000-3,000 denier, tensile strength 200-500 kg, surrounds buffered fiber). (3) **Jacket:** Extrude outer jacket ([polyurethane](thermoplastic-polyurethane), PVC, or LSZH low-smoke zero-halogen compound, 2-4mm OD, flame-retardant UL OFNR or OFNP rated). **Simplex:** 1 fiber, 2-3mm OD. **Duplex:** 2 fibers (TX/RX pair), side-by-side or zipcord (figure-8 cross-section, 5-6mm OD). **Multi-fiber (4-12 fibers):** Bundle buffered fibers, central strength member (fiberglass rod or steel wire), helical lay, outer jacket 8-15mm OD. **Loose-tube cable (outdoor/OSP):** Fiber placed in gel-filled buffer tube (2-3mm ID plastic tube, 10-12 fibers per tube, fiber 1% longer than tube - "excess fiber length" EFL allows thermal expansion/contraction, tube contracts in cold, fiber not stretched, prevents microbending loss). Gel: petroleum jelly or silicone (water-blocking, prevents moisture ingress). Multiple tubes stranded around central strength member (steel wire or fiberglass rod, 2-5mm diameter), water-blocking tape or yarn, corrugated steel or dielectric strength member, PE outer jacket (15-25mm OD, black UV-resistant). **Armored cable:** Steel wire or corrugated steel tape armor (rodent-proof, crush-resistant, direct burial, 20-35mm OD).

**Step 101-120: [Fiber Optic Connector](fiber-optic-connector) Types and Components**
Precision connectors align fiber cores (9-50 µm) for low-loss mating. **LC connector (Lucent Connector):** Small form-factor (SFF, 1.25mm ferrule), push-pull latch, duplex clip, 10-40 Gbps Ethernet standard. **SC connector:** Larger (2.5mm ferrule), push-pull latch, simplex, older standard. **MTP/MPO (multi-fiber push-on):** 12 or 24 fibers in single connector (12-fiber 40G/100G QSFP modules, 24-fiber 400G), rectangular ferrule, pins/sockets for alignment. **FC, ST (legacy):** 2.5mm ferrule, screw-on (FC) or bayonet (ST), telecom/military. **Ferrule:** Precision ceramic (zirconia ZrO₂, 2.5mm or 1.25mm OD, 126-127 µm ID hole for 125 µm fiber, tolerance ±1 µm). Fiber inserted into ferrule hole, adhesive (epoxy or UV-cure acrylate) bonds fiber in ferrule, fiber end polished flush. Ferrule physical contact (PC): curved polish 10-25mm radius, fiber cores touch when mated (return loss >40 dB, back-reflection <–40 dB). Ultra-physical contact (UPC): 8° angle polish (return loss >50 dB, prevents Fresnel reflection, critical for analog CATV, high-power lasers). Angled physical contact (APC): 8° angled ferrule (green color code, return loss >60 dB, fiber end angled so reflection exits cladding, not back to source, used in GPON/FTTx, prevents laser instability). **Connector body:** Thermoplastic (PBT, nylon, LCP), houses ferrule, spring (compression spring pushes ferrule forward, ensures physical contact force 5-10 N), latch or screw coupling. **Boot:** Strain relief boot (rubber or plastic, 5-10mm taper, prevents cable kink at connector).

**Step 121-142: Fiber Connector Termination - Epoxy and Polish**
**Preparation:** Strip cable jacket 50-100mm, expose aramid strength member. Cut buffer coating, expose 250 µm coated fiber 10-20mm. Clean fiber with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) wipe. **Epoxy method (traditional):** (1) Mix two-part epoxy (5-10 minute working time, thermosetting adhesive). (2) Inject epoxy into ferrule hole (syringe, fill from back, expel air bubbles). (3) Insert stripped fiber into ferrule hole (fiber slides through epoxy-filled hole, fiber tip protrudes 1-2mm beyond ferrule end). (4) Cure epoxy (thermal cure 80-100°C, 10-30 minutes in oven, or room-temperature cure 8-24 hours). Epoxy bonds fiber to ferrule ID, anchors fiber. (5) **Cleave excess:** Scribe fiber near ferrule end face (diamond or carbide blade, score coating + glass), snap off (leaves 0.1-0.5mm fiber stub protruding). (6) **Polish:** Mount connector in polishing puck (rubber holder, ferrule end exposed). Polish on lapping film (adhesive-backed abrasive, aluminum oxide or diamond grit, 12 µm → 3 µm → 1 µm → 0.3 µm progression, 4-stage polish). Hand polish or machine (rotary polisher, figure-8 motion, 30-120 seconds per grit, water or IPA lubricant). Final: inspect ferrule end under microscope (100-200×, check fiber core centered, no scratches, chips, epoxy residue). Measure end-face geometry (interferometer, radius of curvature 10-25mm for PC, apex offset <50 µm, fiber undercut/protrusion <50 nm). **Anaerobic adhesive (faster):** Single-part UV-cure or anaerobic adhesive (cures in absence of oxygen inside ferrule hole, 2-5 minutes), no oven needed. **Mechanical splice (field-termination):** Pre-polished connector with internal mechanical splice (V-groove or collet, fiber cleaved flat, inserted, clamped - no polish required, 0.5-1.0 dB insertion loss vs 0.2-0.5 dB for epoxy/polish, but 10× faster field installation).

**Step 143-160: Active Optical Cable (AOC) for Thunderbolt**
Active cable integrates optical fiber + photoelectric conversion in connectors (electrical connector to user, optical signal inside cable). **Construction:** (1) **Electrical connector:** USB-C or Thunderbolt (40 Gbps, 4 lanes × 10 Gbps). (2) **Transmitter module:** Inside connector housing, PCB with laser diode array (4× VCSEL 850 nm vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, 10-25 Gbps each, OM3/OM4 multi-mode fiber compatible) + driver IC (serializer, converts parallel PCIe/Thunderbolt lanes to serial optical). (3) **Optical fiber:** 4-8 fibers (4 TX, 4 RX or bidirectional), multi-mode 50/125 µm OM3 or OM4 (short cable 10-50m, MMF adequate, cheaper than single-mode). Fibers in ribbon or loose-tube, lightweight jacket (1-3mm OD, ultra-flexible silicone or TPE). (4) **Receiver module:** Photodiode array (4× PIN or APD photodiodes, 10-25 Gbps, 850-1,550 nm), transimpedance amplifier TIA, deserializer IC. (5) **Power:** USB-PD VBUS (5-20V) powers TX/RX modules (1-5W total, distributed via cable conductors or separate copper power wires bundled with fiber). **Advantages vs copper Thunderbolt:** Longer reach (copper limited to 0.5-2m for 40 Gbps passive, 3-5m active, fiber 10-100m), lighter weight (fiber 2-5 g/m vs copper 20-50 g/m for shielded multi-pair), no EMI susceptibility. **Disadvantages:** Higher cost ($50-200 vs $15-30 copper), not hot-pluggable while active (laser safety concerns, Class 1 eye-safe <1 mW per fiber, module must disable laser when disconnected, interlock sensing). **Applications:** Pro video editing (4K/8K RED/Arri cameras to Mac Pro, 10-30m studio runs), VR/AR (low-latency headset tether), server/storage (Thunderbolt JBOD arrays, data centers).

**Step 161-175: Optical Performance Testing - Insertion Loss and Return Loss**
**Insertion loss (IL):** Power transmitted through connector or cable. Measure with optical power meter + laser source (1,310 nm or 1,550 nm single-mode, 850 nm or 1,300 nm multi-mode). Reference: launch light into fiber patchcord, measure output power P_ref (bypass device under test DUT). Measurement: insert DUT, measure output P_meas. IL = 10 log(P_ref / P_meas) in dB. **Connector IL specification:** <0.5 dB typical (high-quality LC/SC PC connector, <0.3 dB achievable with precision polish), <0.75 dB max per TIA-568-C.3. Loss contributors: (1) Fresnel reflection (4% per glass-air interface, –14.8 dB return, eliminated by index-matching gel or physical contact). (2) Core misalignment (lateral offset, angular misalignment, gap - each 1 µm lateral offset ≈ 0.2-0.5 dB loss depending on fiber NA). (3) Core diameter mismatch (62.5 µm fiber to 50 µm fiber ≈ 2 dB loss, direction-dependent). (4) Surface defects (scratches, contamination - dust particle 1-10 µm blocks significant core area). **Return loss (RL):** Reflected power (back-reflection). RL = 10 log(P_incident / P_reflected) in dB (positive value, higher = better). Measured with OTDR or optical return loss meter. PC connector: RL >40 dB (0.01% reflection). UPC: >50 dB. APC: >60 dB. Poor RL causes issues: laser instability (external cavity effect, mode hopping), receiver saturation (reflected signal interferes with weak received signal, bit errors in bidirectional systems). **Mating durability:** Connector rated 500-1,000 mating cycles (ferrule end-face wear, IL degrades 0.05-0.2 dB after 500 cycles). Clean ferrules before each mating (compressed air, lint-free wipe with IPA, inspection microscope - contamination #1 cause of high loss/failure).

**Step 176-185: Fiber Splicing - Fusion and Mechanical**
Permanent joining of two fiber ends (lower loss than connectors 0.05-0.2 dB per splice vs 0.3-0.5 dB connector, used in outside plant cables, repair, pigtail splicing). **Fusion splicing:** (1) **Strip fiber:** Remove jacket, buffer, coating (250 µm → 125 µm bare glass, 10-15mm length, mechanical stripper or thermal stripper 800-1,000°C flash burn evaporates acrylate). (2) **Cleave:** Precision cleaver scores fiber with diamond blade, controlled tension snaps fiber (cleave angle <0.5°, flat end-face, critical for low-loss splice). (3) **Fusion splicer:** Align two fibers in V-grooves (precision 1 µm, view with microscope or CCD camera, automated image recognition aligns cores). Electric arc (tungsten electrodes, 2,000-2,500°C, 1-2 seconds, glass surfaces melt, fuse together). (4) **Heat shrink:** Slide heat-shrink splice protector over splice (60mm tube, lined with hot-melt adhesive + steel rod reinforcement), apply heat gun (150-180°C, tube shrinks, encapsulates splice, tensile strength 1-5 kg). **Fusion splice loss:** <0.05 dB typical (single-mode, core-aligned), <0.1 dB (multi-mode). **Mechanical splice:** Align cleaved fibers in V-groove or capillary tube, clamp, index-matching gel fills gap (reduces Fresnel reflection). Loss 0.2-0.5 dB (higher than fusion, easier field installation, no power source needed). **Splice closure:** Outdoor splice enclosure (plastic or metal box, watertight, houses 12-144 splice trays, organizes spliced fibers, wall-mount or pedestal-mount, fiber management prevents bend radius violations <30mm).

**Step 186-195: Applications, Market, and Economics**
**Fiber optic cable markets:** (1) Telecom long-haul (40%, backbone networks, submarine cables, 1,000+ km, single-mode G.652/G.655, DWDM 80+ wavelength channels × 100 Gbps = 8+ Tbps per fiber).

(5) Specialty (2%, military/aerospace, medical endoscopes, sensors, industrial harsh environments). **Pricing:** Bare fiber (250 µm coated, bulk spool): single-mode $0.02-0.05/meter, multi-mode OM3 $0.10-0.20/meter. Duplex tight-buffer cable (indoor): $0.50-1.50/meter (2-fiber). Outdoor loose-tube: $2-8/meter (12-fiber). LC connector (factory-terminated): $2-5 each (single-mode), $1-3 (multi-mode). Patchcord (1-3m pre-terminated duplex): $5-15 retail. Active optical cable (AOC 10m, 40 Gbps Thunderbolt): $80-150 retail. **Manufacturing cost (1m duplex patchcord, multi-mode OM3):** Fiber $0.20 (2× 1m), tight-buffer coating $0.15, aramid yarn $0.10, PVC jacket $0.12, two LC connectors $2.00 (ferrules, bodies, boots), epoxy $0.05, polishing labor/consumables $0.50 (10-15 min per connector × 2), testing $0.20, packaging $0.15. **Total cost $3.47.** Wholesale $5-7 (45-100% margin). Retail $10-18 (100-200% markup). **Production locations:** China (40-50%, Yangtze Optical Fiber, FiberHome, production capacity 300+ million fiber-km/year largest producers), USA (Corning, Panduit, 20-25%), Japan (Sumitomo, Fujikura, 15-20%), Europe (Prysmian, 10%). **Fiber drawing highly automated:** Single preform → 50-2,000 km fiber (OVD preforms largest), draw tower operates 24/7 (unmanned overnight, automated spool change, diameter control), labor mainly quality inspection, preform loading. **Future trends:** (1) Hollow-core fiber (light travels in air core, not glass, lower latency, lower nonlinearity, experimental 0.17 dB/km at 1,550 nm, commercial 2025-2030). (2) Multi-core fiber (7-19 cores in single 125 µm cladding, space-division multiplexing SDM, 10-100× capacity increase, prototype transmission >1 Pbps). (3) Bend-insensitive fiber (G.657, tighter macrobend radius 7.5-10mm vs 30mm standard, allows denser routing, FTTP drop cables).
