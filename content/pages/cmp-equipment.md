# How to Make CMP Equipment

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Applied Materials](/companies/applied-materials)
- [Ebara](/companies/ebara)



Planarizes wafer surface by combining chemical etching and mechanical abrasion. Wafer pressed against rotating pad with abrasive slurry. Removes high spots, creates flat surface for next lithography step. Critical for multi-level interconnects - each metal layer must be flat.

## Components:
[Rotating Platen](rotating-platen) with [Polishing Pad](polyurethane-pads) (polyurethane). [Slurry Distribution](slurry-system) delivers abrasive slurry (silica or alumina nanoparticles + chemicals). [Wafer Carrier](polishing-head) holds wafer, applies controlled pressure (1-7 psi). Wafer and platen rotate in opposite directions. [Metrology](thickness-measurement) measures removal rate in real-time.

**Slurry:** pH-controlled chemistry selectively removes materials. Oxide CMP, tungsten CMP, copper CMP each require different slurry. Removal rate: 100-500 nm/min. Uniformity: ±3% across wafer. Cost: $3-6 million.
