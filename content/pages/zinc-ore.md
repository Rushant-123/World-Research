1. Electromagnetic surveys detect zinc sulfide deposits
2. Diamond drilling confirms ore body geometry
3. Underground decline (access tunnel) excavated at 1:7 gradient
4. Ventilation shafts drilled to supply fresh air
5. Rock bolts and mesh installed for ground support
6. Production drifts developed on 25-meter vertical spacing
7. Long-hole drilling rigs bore upward fan patterns
8. Holes drilled 20-30 meters into ore body
9. Emulsion explosives pumped into blastholes
10. Electronic detonators ensure precise timing
11. Blast fires upward into drilled ring
12. Ore breaks and falls to collection level below
13. Load-haul-dump (LHD) machines scoop ore
14. 15-ton capacity LHDs transport to ore passes
15. Ore gravity-feeds down vertical passes to main haulage
16. Underground trucks haul to shaft bottom
17. Skip hoist lifts ore 500 meters to surface
18. Surface crushing reduces ore to <100mm
19. Flotation circuit separates sphalerite (zinc sulfide)
20. Collectors (xanthates) make zinc minerals hydrophobic
21. Frothers create stable bubble structure
22. Zinc concentrate contains 52-55% zinc
23. Lead minerals separated in second flotation stage
24. Final zinc concentrate grade 57-60% zinc
25. Thickening and filtration reduces moisture to 8%
26. Assay laboratory tests each batch for zinc, lead, iron, silica
27. Concentrate bagged or stored in bulk silos
28. Underground ground control monitoring with extensometers
29. Ventilation delivers 200 cubic meters/second fresh air
30. Refuge chambers provide emergency shelter
31. Water pumping from mine workings (1,000 liters/minute)
32. Backfilling of mined voids with cemented rock
33. Ore reserve calculation updated monthly
34. Production rate: 1.5 million tons ore per year
35. Workforce operates in 12-hour shifts
36. Safety training includes emergency evacuation drills
