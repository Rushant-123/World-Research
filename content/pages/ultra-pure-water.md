# How to Make Ultra-Pure Water

**Market Leader:** [Water Treatment Facilities](/companies/water-treatment-facilities)



Ultra-pure water (UPW) is water purified to extreme levels, with 18.2 MΩ·cm resistivity and parts-per-trillion contamination levels. Essential for semiconductor manufacturing, pharmaceutical production, and laboratory research where even trace impurities cause defects or interfere with processes.

## What is it?

Water with virtually all dissolved ions, organics, particles, gases, and microbes removed. Measured by resistivity: 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25°C (also called Type 1, ASTM D1193, or 18 megohm water). Contains <1 ppb total organic carbon, <1 bacteria/mL, and <1 particle >0.2μm per mL. Used to rinse silicon wafers, dilute chemicals, and clean equipment in semiconductor fabs.

## Steps to Make:

**Pre-Treatment:**
1. Start with [Municipal Water](tap-water) from city supply
2. Municipal water contains: 100-500 ppm dissolved solids, chlorine, organics, bacteria
3. Resistivity of tap water: 5,000-50,000 Ω·cm (very conductive due to ions)
4. Feed water through [Multimedia Filter](sand-filter)
5. Filter contains layers: anthracite coal (top), sand (middle), garnet (bottom)
6. Removes suspended solids, sediment, turbidity
7. Particle removal down to 10-20 microns
8. Backwash filter periodically to remove trapped particles

**Chlorine and Organics Removal:**
9. Pass water through [Activated Carbon Filter](carbon-filter)
10. Activated carbon has massive surface area (500-1,500 m²/g)
11. Microscopic pores adsorb chlorine, chloramines, organic molecules
12. Chlorine reacts with carbon: C + 2Cl₂ + 2H₂O → 4HCl + CO₂
13. Carbon also removes: pesticides, solvents, taste/odor compounds
14. Replace carbon every 6-12 months when exhausted
15. Output: water with <0.1 ppm chlorine, reduced organics

**Reverse Osmosis:**
16. Pressurize water to 150-300 psi using [Pumps](pumps)
17. Force through [Reverse Osmosis System](ro-membrane)
18. RO membrane: thin-film composite (polyamide) on porous support
19. Pores: 0.0001 microns (1 angstrom) - atomic scale
20. Water molecules pass through, ions and molecules >100 daltons rejected
21. Rejects 95-99% of dissolved ions (Na⁺, Cl⁻, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, etc.)
22. Rejects bacteria, viruses, endotoxins, organics >200 daltons
23. RO operates at 75-85% recovery (75% becomes permeate, 25% concentrate waste)
24. Concentrate (reject water) contains concentrated impurities, goes to drain
25. Output: water with 10-50 ppm dissolved solids, resistivity 50,000-200,000 Ω·cm
26. Powered by [Electricity](electricity) for pumps

**Ion Exchange (Deionization):**
27. Pass RO permeate through [Ion Exchange Resin](ion-exchange-resin) beds
28. Two types of resin: cation exchange and anion exchange
29. Cation resin: sulfonated polystyrene beads with SO₃⁻H⁺ groups
30. Removes positive ions: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe³⁺
31. Replaces with H⁺: Na⁺ + H-Resin → Na-Resin + H⁺
32. Anion resin: quaternary ammonium groups with OH⁻
33. Removes negative ions: Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, HCO₃⁻
34. Replaces with OH⁻: Cl⁻ + OH-Resin → Cl-Resin + OH⁻
35. The H⁺ and OH⁻ combine: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O
36. Two-bed system: cation bed first, then anion bed
37. Or mixed-bed system: cation and anion resins mixed together (more efficient)
38. Output: water with <0.1 ppm dissolved ions, resistivity 10-17 MΩ·cm
39. Resin capacity exhausts over time - regenerate with acid (HCl) and base (NaOH)
40. Or use EDI (electrodeionization) - continuous regeneration with electricity

**Degasification:**
41. Water still contains dissolved gases: CO₂, O₂, N₂
42. CO₂ combines with water: CO₂ + H₂O ↔ H₂CO₃ ↔ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻
43. This reduces resistivity
44. Pass through degassing membrane contactor
45. Vacuum or nitrogen sweep removes dissolved gases
46. Or heat water to 80°C to drive off gases
47. Reduces CO₂ to <1 ppb

**UV Oxidation:**
48. Expose water to high-intensity [UV Sterilizer](uv-lamp) at 185nm and 254nm wavelengths
49. 185nm UV breaks chemical bonds in organic molecules
50. Creates hydroxyl radicals (·OH) - powerful oxidizers
51. Organics oxidize to CO₂ and H₂O
52. Reduces total organic carbon (TOC) from 10-100 ppb to <1 ppb
53. 254nm UV kills bacteria by damaging DNA
54. UV dose: 30-100 mJ/cm²

**Ultrafiltration:**
55. Final polishing through [Ultrafiltration](uf-membrane) membranes
56. UF pore size: 0.01-0.02 microns
57. Removes any remaining particles, bacteria, endotoxins, pyrogens
58. Bacteria are 0.2-2 microns - cannot pass through
59. Output: bacteria <0.001 CFU/mL, particles <1 per mL

**Continuous Recirculation:**
60. Store UPW in [Storage Tank](polypropylene-tank)
61. Tank material: polypropylene or PVDF (non-leaching polymers)
62. Never use metal tanks - leach ions
63. Tank pressurized with nitrogen to prevent CO₂ absorption from air
64. Continuously recirculate water through final mixed-bed DI resin and UV
65. Recirculation maintains 18.2 MΩ·cm even when water sits in tank
66. Recirculation rate: complete turnover every 15-30 minutes
67. [Piping](pvc-piping) throughout system: PVC, CPVC, or polypropylene
68. Semiconductor-grade UPW: PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) tubing only
69. All fittings: orbital welded or compression (no threads - trap bacteria)

**Distribution:**
70. Pump UPW to point-of-use through dedicated piping
71. Point-of-use filters (0.2 or 0.1 micron) immediately before use
72. Maintain turbulent flow (prevents bacterial growth in pipes)
73. Some systems have point-of-use mixed-bed DI cartridge for final polishing

**Monitoring:**
74. Continuous resistivity monitoring at multiple points
75. Resistivity sensor: two platinum electrodes, measure conductance
76. Conductance = 1/Resistance, Units: μS/cm (microsiemens per centimeter)
77. 18.2 MΩ·cm = 0.055 μS/cm
78. Monitor total organic carbon (TOC) with online analyzer
79. TOC analyzer: UV oxidation + CO₂ detection
80. Target TOC: <1 ppb (parts per billion)
81. Monitor silica: <1 ppb (important for semiconductor)
82. Monitor bacteria: <0.001 CFU/mL
83. Monitor particle count: <1 particle >0.2μm per mL
84. If any parameter out of spec, alarm triggers

**Quality Grades:**
- Type I (18.2 MΩ·cm): Semiconductor, molecular biology, HPLC
- Type II (1 MΩ·cm): General laboratory, glassware rinsing
- Type III (0.2 MΩ·cm): Glassware washing, media preparation
- WFI (Water for Injection): Pharmaceutical, sterile, endotoxin <0.25 EU/mL

**Semiconductor-Grade UPW Specifications:**
- Resistivity: 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25°C
- TOC: <1 ppb
- Bacteria: <0.001 CFU/mL
- Particles (>0.2μm): <1 per mL
- Dissolved oxygen: <1 ppb
- Silica: <0.5 ppb
- Sodium: <0.1 ppb
- Chloride: <0.1 ppb
- Metals (Fe, Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn): <0.01 ppb each

**Water Usage in Semiconductor Fab:**
- Water consumed per 300mm wafer: 7,500-10,000 liters
- A fab producing 40,000 wafers/month uses 10-15 million liters/day
- 60% for wafer rinsing, 30% for equipment cooling, 10% for facility
- Water cost: $0.50-2 per 1,000 liters for UPW (includes treatment energy)
- Large fabs recycle 70-90% of water after treatment

**Why Such Purity Matters:**
- 1 ppb dissolved ions on wafer surface → causes circuit shorts at nanometer scale
- 1 bacteria → becomes particle during drying, causes chip defect
- 1 ppb organic molecule → interferes with photoresist adhesion
- Semiconductor yield loss from water contamination: 1-5%
- At $5,000-10,000 per 300mm wafer, water quality directly impacts profitability

**Comparison of Water Purity:**
- Tap water: 5,000-50,000 Ω·cm, 100-500 ppm solids
- Distilled water: 100,000-500,000 Ω·cm, 1-10 ppm solids
- Deionized (DI) water: 1-17 MΩ·cm, 0.1-1 ppm solids
- Ultra-pure water: 18.2 MΩ·cm, 0.001-0.01 ppm solids (parts per billion)

**Cost:**
- UPW system (10,000 L/day): $50,000-200,000 capital cost
- Operating cost: $0.50-2 per 1,000 liters
- Energy: 0.5-2 kWh per 1,000 liters
- Maintenance: membrane and resin replacement, UV lamp replacement

Pure water is aggressive - it wants to dissolve things to reach equilibrium. UPW will leach ions from any material it contacts, which is why all wetted surfaces must be high-purity polymers. The final UPW system for semiconductor fabs can cost $10-50 million and consume 10-20% of the fab's total energy budget. Despite its purity, UPW starts absorbing CO₂ from air within seconds of exposure, quickly reducing resistivity to <1 MΩ·cm, which is why point-of-use delivery and nitrogen blanketing are critical.
