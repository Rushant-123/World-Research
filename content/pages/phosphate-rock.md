# How to Make Phosphate Rock

Sedimentary ore - source of phosphorus for fertilizers. Mineral: apatite Ca₅(PO₄)₃(F,Cl,OH), mostly fluorapatite Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆F₂ (42% P₂O₅ theoretical). Uses: fertilizers (85%, DAP/MAP/TSP ammonium/triple superphosphate), animal feed supplements (10%, dicalcium/monocalcium phosphate), industrial chemicals (phosphoric acid, elemental phosphorus, 3%), detergents/food additives (2%, declining). Global production: 240 million tonnes/year rock (2023, 70-75% P₂O₅ concentrate, equivalent to 75-85 Mt P₂O₅). China 45%, Morocco 20%, USA 10%, Russia 6%, others 19%.

**Step 1-20: Sedimentary Phosphorite Formation**
Phosphate deposits: 85% sedimentary marine phosphorite (biological origin), 10% igneous (carbonatite apatite, rare), 5% guano (bird excrement islands, minor historical). **Marine phosphorite:** Formation mechanisms debated (likely cold upwelling currents, deep ocean phosphate-rich water reaches shelf, phytoplankton blooms, organic P burial, microbial precipitation of apatite, diagenesis concentrates, 10-200 million years). Precambrian-Cambrian (Doushantuo China, 600 Mya), Permian (Phosphoria Formation Idaho/Montana/Wyoming, 270 Mya), Cretaceous-Tertiary (Morocco/Western Sahara, 60-100 Mya, largest reserves 50 Gt P₂O₅), Miocene (Florida, North Carolina, 15-20 Mya, partially mined out, reclamation ongoing). **Ore composition:** P₂O₅ content 10-38% (run-of-mine ROM, low-grade <25% requires beneficiation, high-grade >30% direct-ship). Calcium oxide CaO 35-55% (combined in apatite). Fluorine 2-4% (fluorapatite, environmental concern in processing). Minor: uranium U₂₀₈ 50-300 ppm (radioactive, decay series to radon Rn-222, worker protection, 226Ra in phosphogypsum waste), cadmium Cd 5-100 ppm (toxic heavy metal, limits in fertilizer 10-60 mg Cd/kg P₂O₅ depending on country), organic carbon 0.5-5% (kerogen, ancient marine organisms). Gangue: quartz SiO₂ (5-30%, diluent, abrasive, complicates beneficiation), clay minerals (montmorillonite, kaolinite, 3-20%, fine slimes, difficult separation), carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite, 5-40% in carbonate-rich ores Morocco/Tunisia/Algeria). **Global reserves:** 70 billion tonnes rock (equivalent to 20-25 Gt P₂O₅, 250-350 years at current consumption, but distribution uneven). Morocco + Western Sahara 50 Gt (70% of global reserves, near-monopoly, geopolitical significance), China 3.3 Gt, Egypt 3 Gt, Algeria 2.2 Gt, Syria 2 Gt, Russia 1.5 Gt, Peru 0.8 Gt, USA 1 Gt (mostly Florida exhausted grade, Idaho/Utah/Wyoming low-grade reserves). Peak phosphorus debate: some models suggest supply constraints 2030-2050 if demand grows 2-3%/year (food demand), recycling critical (sewage sludge, animal manure, crop residues contain 10-30% of applied P, recover vs runoff eutrophication).

**Step 21-45: [Open Pit Mining](mining-operations) - Florida Pebble Phosphate**
Florida Central Bone Valley: historical major US source (1960s-1990s 50 Mt/year USA production, 2023 10 Mt/year decline, reserves depleted, water table issues, reclamation). **Geology:** Miocene Bone Valley Formation (10-20m thick, depth 5-20m below surface, phosphate pebbles 1-50mm in clay/sand matrix, 10-18% P₂O₅ in-situ, 1-5:1 overburden ratio). **Mining method:** [Dragline](dragline-mining) excavation (walking dragline, 50-100 m³ buckets, 70-90m boom, cast overburden to previously mined pit, expose phosphate matrix). Hydraulic monitor (high-pressure water jet 1-3 MPa, 1,000-5,000 L/min, slurry phosphate matrix 10-30% solids). Pipeline: pump slurry 5-20 km to beneficiation plant (250-400mm HDPE pipe, centrifugal pumps 500-2,000 kW, 10-20 m head per pump, series 5-15 pumps). **Beneficiation:** (1) Screen: separate +1mm pebble from -1mm fines (trommel screens, vibrating screens). Pebble phosphate: 20-30% P₂O₅, wash, size classify, direct to chemical plant (TSP, phosphoric acid). (2) Flotation: -1mm clay/sand/fine phosphate slurry (5-15% P₂O₅). Deslime (hydrocyclones remove -20 µm clays, discard to clay settling areas). Float remaining 20 µm-1mm fraction with fatty acid collectors (oleic acid, tall oil, 0.5-2 kg/tonne, pH 6-7). Froth concentrate: 28-32% P₂O₅, recovery 60-75% of -1mm P (balance lost to slimes). (3) Dry: filter concentrate (18-25% moisture), rotary dryer (natural gas or oil-fired, 150-300°C, 3-8% final moisture). Product: 68-72% BPL (bone phosphate of lime, %BPL = %P₂O₅ × 2.185, trade convention, 68 BPL = 31% P₂O₅). **Reclamation:** Florida law requires reclaimed land productive (agricultural, residential, conservation). Backfill pits, recontour, 0.5-1.5m topsoil/clay cap, seed pasture or wetlands. Timeframe: 2-5 years post-mining, $10,000-50,000/hectare reclamation cost. Legacy: 100,000+ hectares mined 1900-2023, 80% reclaimed, ongoing monitoring gypsum stacks, clay settling ponds (phosphate + fluoride + radionuclides).

**Step 46-70: Morocco Open Pit - High-Grade Sedimentary**
Morocco OCP (Office Chérifien des Phosphates, state-owned, world's largest): 40-45 Mt/year rock production (18-20% of global). **Deposits:** Khouribga (Central plateau, 50+ Gt reserves, 28-32% P₂O₅ in-situ, Cretaceous-Paleocene 70-60 Mya, phosphate beds 15-80m thick, 20-100m overburden). Benguerir, Youssoufia, Boucraâ-Laayoune (Western Sahara, disputed territory, 85% of Morocco reserves, occupied 1976, international law complexity, most customers ignore, imports labeled "Morocco"). **Mining:** Drill-blast-load-haul (similar to coal, limestone). Overburden: remove 20-100m with draglines, shovels, trucks (waste dumps adjacent). Phosphate bed: selective mining (top/bottom beds 18-24% P₂O₅ lower-grade, middle bed 28-34% high-grade, separate blast/haul to maintain product specs). Equipment: 240-400 tonne trucks (Cat 797, Komatsu 980E), 100 m³ shovels, 120 m³ dragline Khouribga mine. Production rate: 5,000-20,000 tonnes/hour (large mines Khouribga 18 Mt/year from single complex). **Beneficiation (if needed):** High-grade >30% P₂O₅ ships direct (74-77 BPL "merchant grade," no washing). Medium-grade 22-30% P₂O₅: wash (scrubbing, screening, attrition remove clay, calcite fines), upgrade to 30-32% P₂O₅. Low-grade <22%: flotation (similar to Florida, reverse flotation to reject silica/carbonate, float phosphate with fatty acids). Dryer: rotary kilns or fluidized beds, reduce moisture from 8-15% to 1-3% (improves handling, prevents caking in ship holds, critical for export). **Export:** Largest global exporter (25-30 Mt/year, 60% of seaborne trade). Destinations: India 30%, Brazil 15%, Europe 15%, China 10%, USA 10%, others 20%. Ports: Casablanca-Jorf Lasfar (20 Mt/year capacity, integrated phosphoric acid/fertilizer production + export terminal), Safi (12 Mt/year), Laayoune (5 Mt/year, Western Sahara, limited international shipping, mostly to OCP plants). Shipping: Panamax 50,000-70,000 DWT, Capesize 100,000-180,000 DWT (bulk carriers, load 10,000-20,000 tph shiploaders). Freight: $15-60/tonne (Morocco to India $25-40/tonne, to Brazil $30-50/tonne depending on bunker fuel prices).

**Step 71-92: China Domestic Production and Consumption**
China: 105 Mt/year rock (2023, 44% of global, but captive consumption, minimal exports). Deposits: Yunnan province (Dianchi, Kunyang, 2 Gt reserves, 22-30% P₂O₅, Sinian-Cambrian 600-500 Mya), Guizhou (Kaiyang, Zhijin, 1 Gt), Hubei (Yichang, 0.5 Gt), Sichuan (Qingping, 0.4 Gt). **Mining:** Underground (60%, room-pillar or sublevel stoping, seams 3-12m thick, 200-800m depth) and open pit (40%, smaller deposits, overburden <50m). Ore grade: 18-30% P₂O₅ (mostly 22-28%, lower than Morocco 30-34%, requires more complex beneficiation). **Beneficiation:** Multi-stage (deslime, flotation, magnetic separation if needed). Collectors: fatty acids + amine + sodium silicate depressant (reject dolomite MgCO₃, calcite CaCO₃, silica). Product: 30-34% P₂O₅ concentrate (68-75 BPL). Recovery: 75-88% (lower than Florida/Morocco due to finer grained phosphate, more gangue, colloidal clays). **Utilization:** 100% domestic consumption (DAP 18-46-0, MAP 11-52-0, NP/NPK compound fertilizers, 85% of production). Imports: 5-10 Mt/year (supplement domestic, high-grade Morocco 30-32% P₂O₅ preferred for H₃PO₄ production, less sulfuric acid consumption, lower gypsum waste). Strategy: self-sufficiency priority (food security, 20% of global population, 9% of arable land, fertilizer critical, reserve estimates 50-80 years domestic supply).

**Step 93-115: [Flotation Beneficiation](flotation-plant) - Technical Details**
Upgrade low-grade phosphate rock (15-25% P₂O₅) to merchant grade (28-34% P₂O₅). **Crushing and grinding:** Jaw/cone crushers reduce ROM 500mm → 10mm. Ball mills: grind to 50-80% passing 150 µm (liberation size for phosphate grains 50-500 µm depending on ore texture). **Desliming:** Critical step (clay slimes -20 µm coat bubbles, interfere flotation, consume reagents). Hydrocyclone: pump slurry (20-35% solids), cyclone removes -20 µm in overflow (90-95% of clays, discharge to thickener, tailings pond). Underflow (deslimed, 50-70% solids): reslurry to 25-35% for flotation. **Reagent conditioning:** (1) Dispersant: sodium silicate (waterglass, 0.5-2 kg/tonne, pH 8-10, disperses residual clays, prevents aggregation). (2) Depressant: quebracho, lignin sulfonate, or starch (0.1-0.5 kg/tonne, adsorbs on silica/carbonate, renders hydrophilic, prevents floating). (3) Collector: fatty acids (oleic acid, tall oil, coconut oil, or sodium oleate, 0.3-1.5 kg/tonne, binds to apatite Ca²⁺ sites, hydrophobic coating). (4) Frother: MIBC, pine oil (0.05-0.2 kg/tonne). pH: adjust with NaOH or Na₂CO₃ to 7-9 (critical, fatty acid ionization pKa ~9, pH >10 depresses phosphate). **Flotation cells:** Mechanical (Denver, Wemco, Outotec, 5-100 m³ cells, impeller aerates + agitates, 8-20 min residence, 4-8 cells per bank). Rougher: 50-70% P recovery, mass pull 40-60% (reject quartz/carbonate-rich tailings). Cleaner: regrind rougher concentrate if needed (liberation), clean in 2-3 stages (reject middlings back to rougher). **Concentrate:** 28-34% P₂O₅ (70-75 BPL), 30-45% CaO, 0.5-3% MgO (low MgO critical, high-Mg ores problematic, precipitates Mg-P in phosphoric acid process, filter issues). Impurities: Fe₂O₃ <2%, Al₂O₃ <2%, SiO₂ 2-8% (lower better, reduce acid consumption). Recovery: 70-90% overall P₂O₅. **Tailings:** 60-75% of feed mass, 4-12% P₂O₅ (uneconomic to recover further), tailings dam (2-20 million tonnes/year per plant, perpetual storage, Florida clay settling areas 5,000-20,000 hectares).

**Step 116-138: [Drying](rotary-dryer) and Product Handling**
Flotation concentrate: 18-30% moisture (filter cake), must dry to 1-4% for storage/shipment (prevent caking, microbial growth, spontaneous combustion if organic-rich, improve flowability). **Rotary dryer:** Inclined rotating cylinder (2-4m diameter, 15-40m length, 2-5 rpm, lifters inside tumble material through hot gas stream). Heat source: natural gas burner, heavy fuel oil, or coal (direct or indirect fired, 600-1,000°C flame, dilute with air to 150-400°C gas temp at inlet). Countercurrent or concurrent flow (countercurrent higher efficiency, concurrent safer for heat-sensitive, phosphate typically countercurrent). Feed rate: 20-200 tph (residence 20-60 min). Exit gas: 90-120°C, dust-laden (cyclones + baghouse collect fines 5-20% of throughput, return to product). Product: 1-4% moisture, 40-60°C. **Alternative: Fluidized bed dryer:** Vertical vessel, hot gas (200-400°C) fluidizes bed of concentrate particles (vigorous mixing, rapid heat transfer, 1-5 min residence vs rotary 20-60 min). Advantages: compact, lower residence, less degradation (some phosphate ores form polyphosphates if overheated >200°C, reduce reactivity in wet-process acid). Disadvantages: more complex, attrition fines, dust carryover. **Cooling:** Rotary cooler or fluid bed cooler (ambient air, cool to <40°C, prevent condensation moisture in storage if hot product in humid climate). **Storage:** Covered sheds or open stockpiles (if moisture <2%, covered if higher). Segregation (different grades 68, 70, 72, 74 BPL, avoid cross-contamination). Load railcars (100-tonne), trucks (25-40 tonne), barges (1,000-3,000 tonne), ships (40,000-180,000 tonne bulk carriers).

**Step 139-158: Specifications and Quality Parameters**
**P₂O₅ content:** Primary specification (28-34% typical merchant grade, "70 BPL" = 32% P₂O₅ common benchmark, "74 BPL" = 34% P₂O₅ premium Morocco/Tunisia, "68 BPL" = 31% P₂O₅ lower-grade). Price: premium $5-20/tonne per 1% P₂O₅ above baseline (74 BPL trades $10-30/tonne above 70 BPL depending on market). **Cadmium:** Environmental concern (phosphate fertilizers main Cd pathway to soils, accumulation over decades, 0.1-0.8 mg Cd/kg soil typical agricultural, 1-3 mg/kg fertilized long-term). Regulations: EU <60 mg Cd/kg P₂O₅ (2021), tighten to 40 mg/kg 2026, 20 mg/kg 2032 (stringent, Moroccan ores 10-50 mg Cd/kg P₂O₅ compliant, some Florida/Chinese ores 60-100 mg/kg exceed, require cadmium removal or blending). Removal technologies: chlorination (pyrometallurgical, 1,200°C with Cl₂, Cd volatilizes as CdCl₂, recover in scrubber, expensive $50-150/tonne rock), solvent extraction (remove from phosphoric acid, more economical $20-40/tonne P₂O₅). **Uranium/radionuclides:** Phosphate ores 50-300 ppm U₃O₈ (uranium-238 decay chain: 226Ra half-life 1,600 years → 222Rn radon gas → 210Pb → 210Po polonium alpha emitters). Concentration in phosphoric acid (U stays in acid, Ra partitions to phosphogypsum waste 90%, regulatory concern). Worker protection: radon monitoring (<4 pCi/L air recommended, 10-100 pCi/L some underground mines, ventilation critical), gamma radiation (phosphate rock 0.5-3 µSv/h, mildly elevated vs background 0.1 µSv/h, shielding, time limits, dosimetry). **Reactivity:** Critical for fertilizer production (faster dissolution = higher citrate-soluble P in fertilizer = better agronomic value). Fineness: 80-95% passing 75 µm (very fine increases reactivity but handling issues, dusty, caking). Carbonate content: <5% preferred (high-carbonate 10-30% ores Morocco/Egypt consume more acid, CO₂ evolution foaming in reactors, lower reactivity). **Moisture:** <3% for export (prevent caking, ship cargo shift risk if wet, heating if organic content >1%, spontaneous combustion rare but documented).

**Step 159-175: Phosphoric Acid Production - Wet Process**
85% of phosphate rock converted to phosphoric acid H₃PO₄ (fertilizer production DAP/MAP/TSP, or merchant acid for detergents/food). **Wet process:** React rock with sulfuric acid (dihydrate or hemihydrate routes). Reaction: Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆F₂ + 10H₂SO₄ + 10-20H₂O → 6H₃PO₄ + 10CaSO₄·2H₂O↓ + 2HF↑ (calcium sulfate phosphogypsum precipitates, filter, discard, acid product). Dihydrate process (most common, 70-80°C): 1 tonne rock (31% P₂O₅) + 2.5-3.0 tonnes H₂SO₄ (98%) → 2.1 tonnes H₃PO₄ (52-54% P₂O₅, 28-30% P₂O₅ basis after dilution) + 4.5-5.5 tonnes gypsum (phosphogypsum, wet basis, 25-30% moisture). Reactor: stirred tank (rubber or acid-resistant brick-lined concrete, 500-3,000 m³ volume, 4-8 hours residence, strong acid + rock slurry 30-50% solids). HF evolution (hydrogen fluoride gas, highly toxic, scrub with water + silica → hexafluorosilicic acid H₂SiF₆, sell or neutralize). Filter: rotary vacuum filter or belt filter (10-20 m² per 10 tph P₂O₅, gypsum cake 25-30% moisture, wash with water, discard). Acid: 28-32% P₂O₅ (crude wet-process acid, dark green-brown from Fe/organic impurities). Concentrate: evaporate to 40-54% P₂O₅ (merchant acid, or DAP/MAP feedstock). **Phosphogypsum:** Major waste (5 tonnes per tonne P₂O₅ produced, 280 Mt/year globally). Composition: 95% CaSO₄·2H₂O, 1-3% P₂O₅ (co-crystallized, unrecovered), 0.5-1.5% fluorides, 10-40 Bq/g 226Ra (radium concentrate from uranium decay, regulatory challenge). Disposal: stacks (tailings-like piles 20-100m tall, 10-100 million tonnes per facility, Florida 1 billion tonnes accumulated, Tampa Bay controversy seepage phosphate/fluoride to groundwater). Utilization <5% (gypsum wallboard technically feasible but radioactivity concern, road base limited adoption, agricultural amendment trials). Mandated reprocessing pilots (recover rare earths, uranium, gypsum, economics marginal).

**Step 176-185: Environmental and Health Impacts**
**Mining:** Land disturbance (Florida 100,000 hectares mined, Morocco 50,000 hectares, reclamation required but legacy issues). Water consumption: 0.3-1.5 m³/tonne rock (beneficiation, dust suppression, 60-90% recycled, clay ponds seep to aquifers, elevated P, F⁻, radionuclides). **Beneficiation:** Clay slimes tailings (phosphate processing 50-70% of feed mass, clay settling areas 5,000-20,000 hectares Florida, slow consolidation 10-50 years, cap + revegetate). Reagents: fatty acids (biodegradable, low toxicity), sodium silicate (alkaline pH 9-11 discharge, neutralize required). **Radon emissions:** Underground mines (radon-222 gas emanates from ore, accumulates in poorly ventilated areas, alpha radiation lung cancer risk, OSHA 4 pCi/L action level, 100 pCi/L Potential Alpha Energy Concentration PAEC, ventilation + respiratory protection). Processing plants: radon from stockpiles (open-air dissipates, <1 pCi/L beyond 100m, not regulatory concern vs underground). **Fluoride:** Phosphate rock 2-4% F (volatilizes as HF in acidulation, SiF₄ silicon tetrafluoride in high-temp processes). Emissions: scrubbers mandatory (wet scrubber, pack tower with water or alkaline solution, >98% HF removal, discharge <0.5 kg F/tonne P₂O₅). Historic contamination: Polk County Florida, Sichuan China (1950s-1980s uncontrolled emissions, fluorosis in cattle, vegetation damage, chronic human exposure >5 mg F/day skeletal fluorosis, joint pain, teeth mottling). Modern: <0.1 mg F/m³ workplace, <10 µg/m³ ambient, compliance via scrubbers + monitoring. **Phosphogypsum:** Leachate contains P, F⁻, 226Ra (1-80 Bq/g, concentrate 20× vs ore). Seepage: impacted groundwater near stacks (P >1 mg/L vs 0.02 mg/L background, fluoride >4 mg/L MCL 4 mg/L drinking water). Regulations: lined stacks (HDPE or compacted clay 10⁻⁷ cm/s), runoff collection, closure (cap + vegetation, post-closure 30-50 years monitoring).

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Trade**
Global phosphate rock: 240 Mt/year production (2023, 70-75% P₂O₅ concentrate equivalent to 75-85 Mt P₂O₅). China 105 Mt (44%, captive), Morocco + Western Sahara 45 Mt (19%, export-focused), USA 23 Mt (9%, declining), Russia 14 Mt (6%), Brazil 7 Mt (3%), Egypt 5 Mt (2%), Jordan 4 Mt (2%), Saudi Arabia 4 Mt (2%), others 33 Mt (13%). **Trade:** 45 Mt/year seaborne (19% of production, concentrated exporters Morocco 65% share, Jordan, Egypt, Peru, Russia, South Africa). Imports: India 8-10 Mt (largest importer, domestic production minimal), China 5-10 Mt (supplement), Brazil 6 Mt (domestic 7 Mt insufficient), Europe 5 Mt (Poland domestic + imports), USA 1-3 Mt (imports supplement Florida decline), others 10 Mt. **Pricing:** $80-250/tonne FOB (70 BPL benchmark, highly volatile, driven by fertilizer demand, sulfuric acid cost, freight). Historical: $50-80/tonne (2000-2007 stable), spike $350-430/tonne (2008 food crisis, 2011 Arab Spring), collapse $90-120/tonne (2013-2015 oversupply), $120-180/tonne (2016-2020), spike $220-250/tonne (2021-2022 pandemic, Ukraine war disrupts fertilizer, Russia/Belarus potash sanctions), decline $130-180/tonne (2023-2024 demand softens). **Cost structure:** Mining $15-40/tonne (Morocco low-cost $20-30/tonne high-grade, USA $30-50/tonne Florida beneficiation, China $40-70/tonne underground). Processing (beneficiation, drying) $10-30/tonne. Freight $15-60/tonne (Morocco to India $25-40/tonne, to Brazil $30-50/tonne). Total delivered cost: $60-150/tonne. Marginal cost $100-120/tonne (high-cost producers China inland, USA), set floor price. **Outlook:** Demand growth 1.5-2% per year (population growth, dietary shifts to meat increase fertilizer per calorie, offsetting yield improvements + precision agriculture). Supply: Morocco expansion (OCP plan 70 Mt/year by 2030, invest $15-25B, maintain market share), peak phosphorus concerns overstated near-term (Morocco reserves 50+ Gt, 500+ years at current rates, but recycling + efficiency critical long-term sustainability, sewage P recovery pilots Europe, manure management, precision application reduce waste 30-50%).

Price: $0.10/kg rock ($100/tonne) represents merchant-grade phosphate rock (30-32% P₂O₅, 70-72 BPL). Range $80-250/tonne depending on grade and market (68 BPL $90-140, 74 BPL $110-180, 2022 spike $220-250, 2023-2024 $130-180). Used in: phosphoric acid production (wet-process H₃PO₄ → fertilizers DAP/MAP/NPK, 85%), animal feed (dicalcium phosphate DCP, monocalcium phosphate MCP, 10%), industrial (food-grade acid for soft drinks, elemental phosphorus, phosphate salts, 3%), direct application (ground rock phosphate, slow-release organic farming, 2%). Per tonne DAP fertilizer (18-46-0): 1.3-1.5 tonnes phosphate rock + 0.45 tonnes ammonia + 2.5 tonnes sulfuric acid → $130-225 rock cost component.
