# How to Make Phosphorus Dopant

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Air Products](/companies/air-products)
- [Voltaix](/companies/voltaix)



Phosphorus creates n-type (negative charge carriers - electrons) silicon. Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons vs silicon's 4, donating extra electron. Used in NMOS transistors, n-wells, source/drain.

## Forms:
**[Phosphine](ph3-gas) (PH₃):** Gas for ion implantation and CVD. Toxic, flammable. Decomposes: 2PH₃ → 2P + 3H₂. Diluted in H₂ or N₂ for safety (1-10% PH₃).

**[Phosphorus Trichloride](pcl3-chemical) (PCl₃):** Liquid source. Reacts with oxygen: 4PCl₃ + 5O₂ → 2P₂O₅ + 6Cl₂. P₂O₅ dissociates to P.

**Red Phosphorus:** Solid source for diffusion.

Concentration: 10¹⁵-10²⁰ atoms/cm³. [Purification](gas-purification) critical - metal contamination disastrous. Purity: 99.999%. Price: $300-1500/kg.
