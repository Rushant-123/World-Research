## Introduction to HDMI Technology

### Step 1: Understanding HDMI Standards
HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a proprietary audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device.

### Step 2: HDMI 2.1 Specifications
HDMI 2.1 supports bandwidth up to 48 Gbps, enabling 8K video at 60Hz and 4K at 120Hz. This requires precise manufacturing tolerances to maintain signal integrity at these extreme data rates.

### Step 3: Type A Connector Configuration
The standard Type A connector features 19 pins arranged in a specific configuration to support multiple differential pairs and power delivery channels.

### Step 4: Pin Layout Design
The 19-pin configuration includes: 4 TMDS data pairs, 1 TMDS clock pair, DDC (Display Data Channel), CEC (Consumer Electronics Control), Hot Plug Detect, and power pins.

### Step 5: Differential Signaling Requirements
Each TMDS (Transition Minimized Differential Signaling) pair must maintain 100Ω differential impedance throughout the connector body to minimize signal reflections.

## Material Selection and Preparation

### Step 6: Contact Pin Material Selection
Contact pins are manufactured from phosphor bronze or beryllium copper alloy, selected for their excellent spring properties and electrical conductivity.

### Step 7: Metal Shell Material
The metal shell is typically stamped from stainless steel or nickel-plated brass, providing electromagnetic shielding and mechanical durability.

### Step 8: Insulator Material Choice
The insulator body uses high-temperature thermoplastic such as LCP (Liquid Crystal Polymer) or PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate) with precise dimensional stability.

### Step 9: Material Certification
All raw materials undergo certification testing to verify compliance with RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and REACH regulations.

### Step 10: Incoming Material Inspection
Raw materials are inspected for dimensional accuracy, material composition, and surface quality using spectrometry and caliper measurements.

## Contact Pin Manufacturing

### Step 11: Strip Material Preparation
Phosphor bronze strip material is unwound from coils and fed into a progressive stamping die system.

### Step 12: Progressive Die Stamping
A multi-stage progressive die performs blanking, forming, and bending operations to create the complex pin geometry in a continuous process.

### Step 13: Pin Contact Area Formation
The contact area is formed with a specific radius and spring force to ensure reliable electrical connection with the mating plug connector.

### Step 14: Tail Formation for PCB Mounting
The PCB mounting tail is formed with either through-hole or surface-mount geometry, depending on the connector variant.

### Step 15: Pin Cleaning Process
Stamped pins undergo ultrasonic cleaning in a multi-stage process using alkaline cleaners to remove stamping oils and contaminants.

### Step 16: Surface Preparation
