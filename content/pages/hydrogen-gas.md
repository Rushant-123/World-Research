# How to Make Hydrogen Gas

H₂ produced primarily by steam methane reforming (SMR). Used in: semiconductor manufacturing (purified silicon, annealing), petroleum refining, ammonia production, fuel cells.

## Steam Methane Reforming:
1. [Natural Gas](methane-source) (CH₄) + [Steam](water-steam) (H₂O) → [Reformer](steam-reformer) at 700-1000°C
2. CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂ (endothermic, requires heat)
3. Water-gas shift: CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂ (increases H₂ yield)
4. [Purification](psa-system): PSA (pressure swing adsorption) removes CO₂, producing 99.999% pure H₂
5. [Compression](gas-compressor): compress to 200-700 bar for storage/transport

**Alternatives:** Electrolysis (H₂O → H₂ + O₂ using electricity - clean but expensive). Steam reforming is cheaper but produces CO₂ (9-10 kg CO₂ per kg H₂). Green hydrogen (electrolysis with renewable energy) eliminates CO₂ but costs 3-5× more.

Industrial H₂: $1-3/kg. Semiconductor-grade (99.9999%): $5-10/kg.
