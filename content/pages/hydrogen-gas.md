Most abundant element in universe, third most produced industrial gas (after nitrogen, oxygen). Global production: 95 million tonnes H₂/year (2023), equivalent to 1,050 billion Nm³. Uses: ammonia synthesis (60%, fertilizers), petroleum refining (25%, hydrocracking, desulfurization), methanol production (8%), semiconductor manufacturing (3%, annealing atmospheres, epitaxy), fuel cells (2%, emerging), food processing (hydrogenation, 1%), metallurgy (1%, reducing atmosphere). Production methods: steam methane reforming SMR (75% of supply, from natural gas), coal gasification (20%, China dominant), electrolysis (4%, chlor-alkali byproduct + dedicated), byproduct from petrochemicals (1%, catalytic reforming, ethylene crackers). Hydrogen economy: clean fuel alternative, energy carrier, decarbonization pathway if produced from renewables ("green hydrogen").

**Step 1-20: [Natural Gas](natural-gas) Feedstock and Desulfurization**
Primary hydrogen source: natural gas (CH₄-rich, 85-95% methane, C₂H₆ ethane 2-8%, C₃H₈ propane 1-3%, C₄H₁₀+ heavier 0-2%, N₂ 1-5%, CO₂ 0-2%). Supplied via pipeline (1-70 bar pressure) or LNG regasification (cryogenic -162°C liquid → ambient gas). **Sulfur removal critical:** Sulfur compounds (H₂S hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans RSH, thiophene C₄H₄S, organic sulfides) poison reforming catalysts (nickel catalyst sulfur tolerance <0.5 ppm, permanent deactivation by sulfur chemisorption blocks active sites). Natural gas contains 1-100 ppm total sulfur (depends on source, sweet gas <4 ppm, sour gas >100 ppm requires pretreatment). **Desulfurization process:** Zinc oxide (ZnO) guard beds. Reactor: vertical vessel 1-3m diameter, 3-8m tall, packed with ZnO pellets (3-8mm diameter, high surface area 20-80 m²/g, porous structure). Operating: 300-400°C, 20-40 bar pressure (matched to reformer inlet). Reactions: ZnO + H₂S → ZnS + H₂O (zinc sulfide forms, irreversible at these conditions, Ksp very low). RSH + ZnO → ZnS + ROH (mercaptans). Organic sulfur: hydrogenolysis over CoMo catalyst upstream (cleaves C-S bonds, converts to H₂S, then ZnO removes). Bed lifetime: 1-3 years (depends on sulfur loading, 20-40% ZnO converted to ZnS before breakthrough, replace entire bed). Effluent sulfur: <0.1 ppm (specification for nickel catalyst protection). **Alternative desulfurization:** Activated carbon adsorption (ambient temperature, regenerable), amine scrubbing (for H₂S), catalytic oxidation Claus process (if high H₂S), membrane separation.

**Step 21-48: Primary Steam Reforming - [Reformer Furnace](reformer-furnace)**
Core reaction: CH₄ + H₂O ⇌ CO + 3H₂ (strongly endothermic, ΔH°₂₉₈ = +206 kJ/mol, requires external heat). **Feedstock preparation:** Mix desulfurized natural gas with [steam](process-steam) (H₂O:CH₄ molar ratio 2.5-4.0:1, typical 3:1, excess steam shifts equilibrium toward H₂, prevents carbon deposition C(s) + H₂O → CO + H₂). Preheat mixture to 500-650°C using flue gas heat recovery (recuperative heat exchangers). **[Reformer design](reformer-furnace):** Box-type or cylindrical furnace (10-30m tall, 5-15m wide/diameter, refractory-lined walls). Contains 40-400 vertical catalyst tubes (100-150mm outer diameter, 80-120mm inner diameter, 10-15m long, wall thickness 10-20mm). Tube material: centrifugally cast high-nickel alloy (HK40, HP40, or HP-modified, composition 25% Cr, 35% Ni, 0.4% C, balance Fe, withstands 1,050°C, resists carburization, creep). Tube lifetime: 10-15 years (gradual creep damage, oxidation, replace during turnaround). **Catalyst:** Nickel on alumina support (15-25% Ni, α-Al₂O₃ carrier, pellets or rings 10-20mm size). Loading: 10-30 tonnes per reformer. Surface area: 5-15 m²/g. Active sites: metallic Ni⁰ crystallites (5-20 nm diameter) dispersed on support. Promoters: potassium (K₂O 0.5-2%, electronic promoter), calcium (CaO 1-5%, sintering inhibitor, CO₂ sorbent). Catalyst bed: dense packed tubes, 3-8m catalyst height per tube. **Heating:** Burners (30-200 burners per furnace) fire natural gas or hydrogen-rich offgas along tube exterior. Burner arrangement: top-fired (flames down), side-fired (horizontal flames), terrace-fired (stepped levels). Flue gas: 900-1,200°C near burners, exits stack 300-500°C after heat recovery. Heat flux: 80-150 kW/m² tube surface (high flux risks tube overheating, coking). Tube metal temperature: 950-1,050°C (design limit, exceeding causes rapid creep failure). **Reaction conditions:** Pressure 20-40 bar (high pressure thermodynamically unfavorable but allows smaller equipment, reduces compression later). Temperature: inlet 500°C, outlet 750-900°C (equilibrium-limited, higher T increases conversion). Conversion: 65-75% CH₄ per pass (equilibrium at 850°C/25 bar ~70%). Space velocity: GHSV 2,000-6,000 h⁻¹ (gas hourly, volume gas per volume catalyst per hour). Residence time: 0.5-2 seconds in catalyst bed. **Effluent composition:** 10-15% H₂, 50-60% (dry basis), 8-12% CO, 7-10% CO₂, 2-5% CH₄ (unreacted), 1-2% N₂+Ar (from air ingress or natural gas impurities), balance H₂O steam (20-30% wet basis). **Side reactions:** CH₄ + 2H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + 4H₂ (ΔH° = +165 kJ/mol, also occurs). CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂ (water-gas shift, ΔH° = -41 kJ/mol, exothermic, equilibrium-limited by temperature, moderate extent in reformer).

**Step 49-68: Secondary Reforming with Air Injection**
Further convert unreacted methane, introduce nitrogen for ammonia synthesis (if producing H₂ for ammonia plant, otherwise skip this step). **Secondary reformer:** Refractory-lined vessel (3-6m diameter, 10-20m tall), combustion zone (top) + catalyst bed (bottom). **Air injection:** Compressed air (or oxygen-enriched air, 21-30% O₂) injected into hot reformed gas stream (750-850°C from primary reformer). Combustion: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O (rapid exothermic, raises temperature to 950-1,100°C, no catalyst needed for combustion). H₂ also burns: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O (consumes some product hydrogen, but heat drives further reforming). Air ratio: stoichiometric to provide N₂:H₂ = 1:3 final ratio (for ammonia), or substoichiometric if pure H₂ desired. **Catalytic zone:** Nickel catalyst (similar to primary reformer, 10-50 tonnes) in lower section. High temperature 950-1,050°C drives equilibrium: remaining CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂. Exit CH₄: <0.5% (slip, near-complete conversion). **Effluent composition (ammonia plant case):** H₂ 50-55%, N₂ 15-18% (from air), CO 8-10%, CO₂ 8-10%, H₂O 15-20%, CH₄ <0.5%, Ar 0.3-0.5% (from air, inert accumulation problem in ammonia loop). **Pure H₂ production (no air):** Skip secondary reformer, or use oxygen instead of air (O₂ + CH₄ → syngas, no N₂ dilution, autothermal reforming ATR or partial oxidation POX). Temperature also drives CO shift reaction partially (CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂, equilibrium at 1,000°C favors CO, but fast kinetics converts ~30-40% before cooling).

**Step 69-92: High-Temperature Shift (HTS) Conversion**
Remove carbon monoxide (CO poisons downstream catalysts, PSA adsorbents; also increases H₂ yield via water-gas shift). **HTS reactor:** Vertical vessel (2-5m diameter, 5-12m tall, carbon steel shell, refractory or stainless lining). Packed with iron-chromium oxide catalyst (Fe₃O₄-Cr₂O₃, 85-92% Fe₃O₄, 8-15% Cr₂O₃, pellets 5-10mm, bulk density 1.2-1.5 g/cm³). Catalyst loading: 20-80 tonnes per reactor. **Reaction:** CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂ (water-gas shift, mildly exothermic ΔH° = -41 kJ/mol, equilibrium-limited, favored by lower temperature but requires moderate temp for kinetics). **Operating conditions:** Inlet temperature: 310-380°C (preheat reformed gas from 950°C using steam generation, waste heat boilers). Outlet temperature: 400-450°C (adiabatic temperature rise 40-70°C from exothermic reaction). Pressure: 20-35 bar (inherited from reformer). Steam:CO ratio: 2-4:1 (excess steam drives equilibrium, typical 2.5:1). Space velocity: GHSV 1,500-4,000 h⁻¹. Residence time: 1-3 seconds. **Conversion:** Reduce CO from 10-12% to 2.5-3.5% (65-70% conversion, approach equilibrium within 10-20°C). Increase H₂ from 55% to 60-62%. **Catalyst activity:** Iron oxide activated by reduction (Fe₂O₃ → Fe₃O₄ → Fe⁰, but Fe₃O₄ is active phase, over-reduction to metallic Fe causes methanation side reaction CO + 3H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O, undesirable). Chromium stabilizes structure, prevents sintering. Lifetime: 3-5 years (deactivation by sintering, sulfur poisoning if desulfurization incomplete, chloride attack, replace during turnaround). Regeneration: not feasible, spent catalyst discarded or recycled (Fe content). **Effluent gas:** H₂ 60-62%, CO₂ 18-22% (increased from CO shift), CO 2.5-3.5% (residual), H₂O 15-20%, N₂ 10-15% (if ammonia case), CH₄ 0.2-0.5%, trace Ar.

**Step 93-112: Low-Temperature Shift (LTS) for Final CO Removal**
Further reduce CO to <0.5% (specification for many hydrogen users, PSA, methanation, or ammonia synthesis). **LTS reactor:** Similar design to HTS, smaller (1-3m diameter, 3-8m tall). Catalyst: copper-zinc oxide on alumina (CuO-ZnO-Al₂O₃, 30-40% CuO, 30-40% ZnO, 20-30% Al₂O₃, tablets 3-8mm, bulk density 1.0-1.3 g/cm³). Loading: 5-30 tonnes. **Reaction:** Same CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂ shift, but lower temperature favors thermodynamics. **Operating conditions:** Inlet: 190-220°C (cool HTS effluent using steam generation, preheaters). Outlet: 220-260°C (adiabatic rise 30-40°C, less exothermic effect due to lower CO concentration). Pressure: 20-35 bar. Steam:CO ratio: 3-5:1 (higher than HTS, ensure complete conversion, prevent Cu catalyst reduction). GHSV: 1,000-3,000 h⁻¹. **Conversion:** Reduce CO from 3% to 0.2-0.5% (85-95% conversion of remaining CO, approach equilibrium <5°C). H₂ increases to 63-65%. **Catalyst activation:** As-produced catalyst is oxide (CuO + ZnO). Reduce in-situ with dilute H₂ (2-5% H₂ in N₂ or steam, gradually increase to 100% H₂ over 24-72 hours, 150-250°C). Reaction: CuO + H₂ → Cu⁰ + H₂O (exothermic, control rate to prevent overheating, sintering). Active catalyst: metallic copper nanoparticles (5-15 nm) dispersed on ZnO-Al₂O₃. **Sensitivity:** Pyrophoric if exposed to air when hot (Cu⁰ + O₂ → ignition risk, passivate with dilute O₂ or inert gas before opening). Sulfur poisoning: <0.1 ppm H₂S tolerance (lower than Fe catalyst, requires excellent desulfurization upstream). Chloride poisoning: <0.01 ppm HCl (from water or feedstock contaminants). Lifetime: 2-5 years (sintering, poisoning, replacement). **Effluent gas:** H₂ 63-66%, CO₂ 20-24%, CO 0.2-0.5%, H₂O 10-15%, N₂ 10-15% (ammonia case), CH₄ 0.2-0.5%, Ar 0.3-0.5%.

**Step 113-138: CO₂ Removal by Amine Scrubbing**
Remove carbon dioxide (inert diluent, reduces H₂ purity, problematic in ammonia synthesis, cryogenic H₂ separation, or fuel cells). **Absorber tower:** Vertical column (1-5m diameter, 15-40m tall, carbon steel), packed with structured packing (Mellapak, Flexipac, metal or plastic, high surface area 250-500 m²/m³) or random packing (Pall rings, Raschig rings, ceramic or metal). **Amine solution:** Aqueous alkanolamine (15-30% by weight). Types: (1) Monoethanolamine MEA (H₂N-CH₂CH₂-OH, 15-20%, fast kinetics, high CO₂ loading 0.4-0.5 mol CO₂/mol MEA, corrosive, degrades with O₂/CO₂). (2) Diethanolamine DEA (HN(CH₂CH₂OH)₂, 20-25%, slower, less corrosive). (3) Methyldiethanolamine MDEA ((CH₃)N(CH₂CH₂OH)₂, 30-50%, selective for H₂S over CO₂, low corrosion, lower capacity). (4) Mixed amines (MDEA + piperazine activator, improved kinetics). **Absorption:** Cool syngas to 30-50°C (using cooling water heat exchangers, lower temp favors absorption). Gas flows up column, lean amine (CO₂-depleted, 0.05-0.15 mol CO₂/mol amine) flows down (countercurrent, 20-40m packing height contact). Reaction: 2RNH₂ + CO₂ ⇌ RNH₃⁺ + RNHCOO⁻ (carbamate formation, reversible). Also: RNH₂ + CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ RNH₃⁺ + HCO₃⁻ (bicarbonate). Absorption pressure: 20-35 bar (higher pressure increases CO₂ partial pressure, drives absorption). CO₂ removal: 90-99% (exit gas <0.1-2% CO₂). Rich amine exits bottom (0.45-0.55 mol CO₂/mol amine, saturated). **Treated gas:** H₂ 75-85% (dry basis, depends if N₂ present), CO 0.2-0.5%, CO₂ 0.1-2%, CH₄ 0.2-0.5%, N₂ 12-15% (ammonia case) or trace (pure H₂ case), Ar 0.4-0.5%, H₂O saturated at 30-50°C (5-12 kPa partial pressure). **Amine regeneration (stripper):** Rich amine heated to 100-120°C in reboiler (steam-heated or hot oil, 1.5-2.5 bar pressure). Stripper column (1-3m diameter, 10-25m tall, similar packing). Heating reverses reaction: RNH₃⁺ + RNHCOO⁻ → 2RNH₂ + CO₂↑ (gas). CO₂ vapor exits top (98-99.5% pure, water-saturated), compress and vent or capture (carbon capture and storage CCS if facility equipped, sequestration in geological formations or use for enhanced oil recovery EOR, urea production, carbonation). Lean amine exits bottom, cool to 30-40°C, recycle to absorber. Makeup amine: 0.5-2 kg/tonne H₂ (losses to degradation, vaporization, entrainment). **Alternative CO₂ removal:** Pressure swing adsorption PSA (zeolite or activated carbon, no chemicals, but lower purity). Cryogenic (cool to -60 to -100°C, CO₂ freezes or liquefies, high energy). Membrane separation (polymeric or ceramic membranes, selective permeation, emerging technology). Hot potassium carbonate (Benfield process, K₂CO₃ + CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ 2KHCO₃, older technology, high-pressure applications).

**Step 139-160: Methanation (Final Trace CO/CO₂ Removal)**
Remove final traces CO + CO₂ (parts-per-million levels) before hydrogen purification or ammonia synthesis. Even 10-100 ppm CO poisons ammonia catalyst (Fe), PSA adsorbents, fuel cell anodes (Pt catalyst). **Methanation reactor:** Small vessel (0.5-2m diameter, 2-6m tall, stainless steel or carbon steel). Catalyst: nickel on alumina (10-25% Ni, high surface area 100-200 m²/g, pellets or spheres 3-5mm). Loading: 1-10 tonnes. **Reactions:** CO + 3H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O (exothermic, ΔH° = -206 kJ/mol, essentially irreversible at these conditions). CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O (ΔH° = -165 kJ/mol). **Operating conditions:** Inlet: 250-350°C (preheat if needed). Pressure: 20-35 bar. Space velocity: GHSV 3,000-10,000 h⁻¹ (short residence 0.3-1 second sufficient, fast kinetics). **Conversion:** Reduce CO from 0.3% to <10 ppm. CO₂ from 0.5% to <100 ppm. Converts to CH₄ (now inert, doesn't poison catalysts). **Effluent gas:** H₂ 74-80% (slight reduction, consumed in methanation), CO <10 ppm, CO₂ <50-100 ppm, CH₄ 0.5-1.5% (increased from methanation + feedstock slip), N₂ 12-15% or trace, H₂O 2-5% (from methanation, then condense in coolers). **Cooling and drying:** Cool to 30-40°C (shell-tube heat exchangers, cooling water or air), knockout drum separates condensed water. Dry further if needed: molecular sieve (4Å zeolite adsorbs H₂O, dew point <-60°C) or alumina beds. Final syngas: ready for PSA purification or ammonia compressor (if ammonia plant).

**Step 161-182: [Pressure Swing Adsorption](pressure-swing-adsorption) (PSA) Purification to High-Purity H₂**
Separate hydrogen from impurities (CH₄, N₂, CO, CO₂, Ar) to 99.9-99.999% purity. **PSA principle:** Selective adsorption of impurities on solid adsorbent at high pressure, desorption at low pressure (regeneration). Hydrogen (smallest molecule) adsorbs weakly, passes through. Larger molecules (N₂, CO, CH₄, CO₂) adsorb strongly, retained. **PSA system:** Multiple adsorber vessels (4-12 vessels, typically 6-10, 1-4m diameter, 5-15m tall, carbon steel, operate in staggered cycle). Adsorbent layers (multi-bed, total 3-8m height): (1) Bottom: alumina or silica gel (remove water, <1 ppm, protect zeolite). (2) Middle: activated carbon or zeolite 5A (remove CO, CO₂, hydrocarbons, 1-3m layer). (3) Top: zeolite 5A or 13X or carbon molecular sieve (remove N₂, CH₄, 1-3m layer). Total adsorbent: 10-50 tonnes per vessel. **Cycle steps (per vessel, 5-20 min total cycle):** (1) Adsorption: Feed gas (25-35 bar, 30°C) enters bottom, flows up through beds. Impurities adsorb, pure H₂ exits top (product, 99.9-99.999% purity, 85-95% recovery). Duration: 1-10 min. (2) Depressurization: Stop feed, reduce pressure to 1-3 bar (vent gas or use for pressure equalization with another vessel), partial desorption begins. (3) Purge: Introduce pure H₂ product (small slip stream 5-15% of product) at low pressure, flows down through beds, strips impurities, exits bottom (tail gas, 40-60% H₂, 10-20% CH₄, 10-20% N₂, 5-15% CO₂, 5-10% CO). Duration: 1-5 min. (4) Repressurization: Introduce feed gas, pressure increases 1 bar → 25-35 bar, ready for next adsorption. Vessels operate in parallel/staggered: while one adsorbs, others depressurize/purge/repressurize (continuous product flow). **Product hydrogen:** 99.9% (industrial grade, <1,000 ppm impurities), 99.99% (high-purity, <100 ppm), 99.999% (ultra-high-purity UHP, <10 ppm, semiconductor/electronics), 99.9999% (6N, <1 ppm, specialty). Impurities: N₂ 10-500 ppm, CH₄ 5-200 ppm, CO <5-50 ppm, CO₂ <5-50 ppm, Ar 1-50 ppm, H₂O <1-5 ppm. **Tail gas utilization:** Burn as fuel in reformer furnace (40-60% H₂ content, heating value 8-15 MJ/Nm³), recovered 60-70% of heating value. Or: recycle to reformer feed (increases efficiency, but complexity). **PSA efficiency:** H₂ recovery 85-95% (higher pressure ratio, more purge gas, higher purity → lower recovery, trade-off). Adsorbent lifetime: 5-10 years (gradual capacity loss, attrition, dust formation, replace during turnaround).

**Step 183-195: Alternative Production: Electrolysis and Chlor-Alkali Byproduct**
**Water electrolysis:** H₂O → H₂ + ½O₂ (electricity splits water, 2.46V thermodynamic minimum, actual 1.8-2.4V per cell depending on technology). Technologies: (1) Alkaline electrolysis (oldest, 1890s, 30% KOH electrolyte, nickel electrodes, 60-70% efficiency, $500-1,500/kW capex, operating 60-85°C/1-30 bar, mature). (2) PEM (proton exchange membrane, 1960s-now, solid polymer electrolyte Nafion, Pt/Ir catalysts, 65-75% efficiency, $1,000-2,500/kW capex, 50-80°C/30-80 bar, compact, fast response). (3) Solid oxide electrolysis SOEC (high-temp 700-900°C, ceramic electrolyte, 80-90% efficiency with waste heat, $2,000-5,000/kW capex, early commercial). Energy consumption: 45-55 kWh/kg H₂ (alkaline), 42-50 kWh/kg (PEM), 35-45 kWh/kg (SOEC). Cost: $4-10/kg H₂ (if electricity $0.05-0.10/kWh renewable, competitive with SMR $1.5-3/kg only if very cheap renewables <$0.03/kWh). **Green hydrogen:** Electrolysis powered by renewable electricity (solar, wind, hydro, zero-carbon). Global capacity: 0.5 Mt H₂/year (2023, <1% of total, but growing rapidly, 100+ projects announced, targets 10-20 Mt/year by 2030). Applications: decarbonizing ammonia, steel (direct reduced iron DRI), refining, transport (fuel cells). Challenges: high cost (2-3× SMR), electrolyzer capex, renewable electricity availability/variability (need storage or grid connection), water consumption (9 kg H₂O per kg H₂, issue in arid regions). **Chlor-alkali byproduct hydrogen:** Membrane cell electrolysis: 2NaCl + 2H₂O → Cl₂ + H₂ + 2NaOH produces 0.025 kg H₂ per kg NaOH (or 0.028 kg H₂ per kg Cl₂). Global chlor-alkali: 80 Mt NaOH/year → 2 Mt H₂/year byproduct (2% of global H₂, significant). Purity: 99-99.5% H₂ (with 0.5-1% O₂ contamination from membrane crossover, must remove for sensitive applications). Purification: PSA (remove O₂, N₂ → 99.9-99.999%), catalytic O₂ removal (Pd catalyst, H₂ + ½O₂ → H₂O at 150-300°C, then dry), membrane separation. Use: on-site fuel (burn in boilers, 40-50% of byproduct H₂), sell as industrial gas (20-30%), ammonia/methanol plants (15-25%), hydrogenation (food, petrochemicals, 5-10%), vent or flare (5-10%, if no market). Economics: byproduct H₂ low marginal cost ($0.5-1.5/kg, only purification/compression, no feedstock), competes with SMR in regions with chlor-alkali plants. **Other byproduct sources:** Catalytic reforming (naphtha → aromatics + H₂ in refineries, 0.5-1 Mt/year), ethylene crackers (steam cracking of naphtha/ethane, 0.3-0.5 Mt/year), styrene production (ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, 0.1 Mt/year). Byproduct total: 3-4 Mt H₂/year (3-4% of supply, typically used internally in refineries/chemical plants).

Price: $2.00/kg represents merchant hydrogen (compressed gas, 99.9-99.99% purity, delivered in cylinders or tube trailers). Actual prices: $1.50-3.00/kg bulk (pipeline or on-site SMR, large volume contracts, refineries, ammonia plants), $3-8/kg packaged (compressed cylinders 200-300 bar, small volumes), $8-15/kg ultra-high-purity UHP (99.9999%, semiconductor grade, specialty gas suppliers). Liquid hydrogen: $4-10/kg (cryogenic -253°C, 70 kg/m³ density, trucked in dewars, aerospace, research, emerging fuel cell applications). Green hydrogen (electrolysis renewable): $4-12/kg (2024, declining with scale + cheap renewables, target $2-3/kg by 2030). Uses: ammonia synthesis (consumes 30-35 Mt H₂/year, $1.50-2.50/kg feedstock cost → $45-87/tonne NH₃ hydrogen component), petroleum refining (25 Mt/year, $1.50-3/kg, desulfurization hydrocracking → ~$40-80/barrel processing cost contribution), methanol (8 Mt H₂/year, $1.80-2.50/kg → $150-200/tonne methanol hydrogen cost), semiconductors (0.05 Mt/year UHP, $10-15/kg for epitaxy/annealing atmospheres, <$0.01 per chip). Per chip allocation: H₂ used in various fab steps (diffusion furnaces, epitaxy, forming gas anneal 5% H₂ in N₂, total <0.1 g H₂ per wafer, <0.01 mg per chip, cost <$0.0001/chip, negligible).
