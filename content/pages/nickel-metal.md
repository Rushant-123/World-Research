# How to Make Nickel Metal

Nickel - essential metal for stainless steel (70% of demand), lithium-ion batteries (15%, growing rapidly for EVs), superalloys (10%), electroplating (5%). Extracted from laterite ores (70% of reserves, HPAL pressure acid leaching) or sulfide ores (30% of production, traditional flash smelting). Global production: 3.3 million tonnes/year. Top producers: Indonesia (1.6 Mt, 48%), Philippines (0.4 Mt, 12%), Russia (0.22 Mt, 7%), New Caledonia (0.19 Mt, 6%), Australia (0.16 Mt, 5%). Final purity: 99.8-99.99% Ni for various applications.

**Step 1-12: Laterite Ore Mining and Composition**

[Laterite ore](laterite-mining): weathered nickel-bearing rocks in tropical climates. Formed by leaching of silica/magnesium from ultramafic rocks (peridotite), concentrating iron/nickel oxides. Two types: (1) Limonite (iron-rich, 1-2% Ni, 40-50% Fe, ochre-colored, near surface 0-20m depth, FeO(OH) goethite + Ni substitution). (2) Saprolite (magnesium-rich, 1.5-2.5% Ni, 15-25% Fe, 15-30% Mg, green, 20-50m depth, serpentine minerals (Mg,Ni)₃Si₂O₅(OH)₄). Deposits: Indonesia (Sulawesi, Halmahera, 1.5+ Gt reserves), Philippines (Mindanao, Palawan), New Caledonia (world's highest-grade 2-3% Ni), Brazil, Cuba, Australia. Open-pit mining: remove overburden (topsoil 1-5m), extract ore horizons (5-30m thick), load into trucks (50-150 tonne haul trucks), transport to processing plant or port (direct shipping ore DSO for smelting in China). Ore grading: handheld XRF analyzers, separate high-grade (>1.8% Ni) from low-grade (<1.5% Ni), blend for consistent feed (1.8-2.2% Ni typical plant feed). Environmental: deforestation (tropical rainforest clearing), erosion, acid mine drainage (sulfide-bearing serpentinite oxidizes).

**Step 13-28: Laterite Processing - HPAL (High-Pressure Acid Leach)**

Modern dominant technology for limonite laterites (Indonesia, Philippines operations). Crush ore to -25mm (jaw crusher + cone crusher). Slurry preparation: mix with water (30-40% solids, 300-400 g/L Ni ore). Preheat slurry to 100-120°C in heat exchangers (recover heat from autoclave discharge). **[HPAL autoclave](pressure-acid-leach):** Horizontal pressure vessel (titanium-lined, 4-6m diameter, 30-50m long, compartmentalized), feed slurry + concentrated [sulfuric acid](sulfuric-acid) (H₂SO₄, 93-98%, 300-500 kg acid per tonne ore). Operating conditions: 250-270°C, 45-55 bar pressure (saturated steam pressure), 60-90 minutes residence time. Reactions: laterite minerals dissolve in acid. Limonite: 2FeO(OH) + 3H₂SO₄ → Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 4H₂O (iron sulfate, soluble). Nickel oxides: NiO + H₂SO₄ → NiSO₄ + H₂O. Cobalt: CoO + H₂SO₄ → CoSO₄ + H₂O (valuable co-product, 0.05-0.15% Co in ore). Magnesium: MgO + H₂SO₄ → MgSO₄ + H₂O (consumes acid, dilutes solution). Aluminum, chromium partially dissolve. Silica remains insoluble (SiO₂ unreactive). Extraction efficiency: 90-95% Ni, 80-90% Co, 50-70% Fe. Autoclave discharge: hot slurry (250-270°C, 50 bar), flash to atmospheric pressure in flash tanks (steam generation, heat recovery), cool to 80-100°C.

**Step 29-45: Neutralization and Iron Removal**

HPAL leach liquor: highly acidic (pH 0.5-1.0), contains Ni²⁺ (8-15 g/L), Co²⁺ (0.5-1.5 g/L), Fe³⁺ (30-60 g/L), Mg²⁺ (15-30 g/L), Al³⁺ (3-8 g/L), free H₂SO₄. Separate solids (undigested silica, sulfur compounds) by thickeners (30-80m diameter, 4-8 hours residence), decant clear pregnant leach solution (PLS). **Iron removal:** Add [limestone](limestone) slurry (CaCO₃) or neutralized tailings (calcium sulfate, magnesium hydroxide from previous batches) to PLS at 80-100°C. Neutralize to pH 2.5-3.5 (controlled addition, 30-60 minutes). Reactions: Fe³⁺ + 3OH⁻ → Fe(OH)₃ ↓ (ferric hydroxide precipitates as gelatinous brown sludge, iron oxy-hydroxide). Fe²⁺ oxidizes to Fe³⁺ in presence of oxygen, then precipitates. Co-precipitation: ~50% of dissolved aluminum, chromium precipitate with iron. Nickel, cobalt remain soluble at pH 2.5-3.5 (don't precipitate until pH >6.5 for Ni, pH >7.5 for Co). Thickening: separate iron hydroxide sludge (10-25% solids, "goethite residue," neutralize further with lime to pH 9-11, dispose in tailings facility). Clarified solution: 8-15 g/L Ni, 0.5-1.5 g/L Co, <0.5 g/L Fe, 15-30 g/L Mg, 1-3 g/L Al, pH 3-3.5.

**Step 46-62: Solvent Extraction (SX) for Nickel/Cobalt Separation**

Separate nickel from cobalt and impurities using solvent extraction. **Nickel extraction:** Mix clarified solution with organic solvent (kerosene + extractant, typically di-2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid DEHPA or Cyanex 272, 15-30% in kerosene). Mixer-settler units: 3-5 stages, mix aqueous + organic (5-10 min, turbulent, phases disperse), settle (15-30 min, phases separate by density difference, organic 0.8 g/mL, aqueous 1.2 g/mL). Nickel extraction: Ni²⁺ + 2(HR)₂ → NiR₂·2HR + 2H⁺ (nickel forms complex with extractant, transfers to organic phase). pH control: maintain pH 4.5-5.5 (add ammonia or limestone neutralization, too low pH = poor extraction, too high = cobalt co-extracts, magnesium precipitates as hydroxide). Cobalt mostly remains in aqueous raffinate (different pH selectivity). **Scrubbing:** Wash loaded organic with dilute acid (H₂SO₄, pH 2-3, 1-2 stages) to remove co-extracted cobalt, manganese, zinc. **Stripping:** Contact scrubbed organic with concentrated sulfuric acid (150-200 g/L H₂SO₄, 2-4 stages, reverse extraction). Ni²⁺ strips back to aqueous: NiR₂·2HR + 2H⁺ → Ni²⁺ + 2(HR)₂. Nickel strip solution: 60-90 g/L Ni, <0.5 g/L Co, <0.1 g/L Fe, pH 1.5-2.5. Organic regenerated, recycles to extraction.

**Step 63-78: Nickel Electrowinning**

Produce nickel metal directly from purified nickel sulfate solution by electrolysis. Adjust strip solution: add sodium hydroxide to pH 3.5-4.0 (precipitate residual iron, aluminum, chromium as hydroxides, filter), add sodium chloride (5-10 g/L Cl⁻ improves anode kinetics). **Electrowinning cell:** Concrete or polymer-lined tank (4m × 2m × 1.5m deep), 40-80 cells in series. Electrolyte: 60-80 g/L Ni²⁺ as NiSO₄, 30-40 g/L H₂SO₄, 40-50°C. Anodes: lead-calcium alloy (Pb-Ca-Sn, dimensionally stable, inert, evolves oxygen) or DSA (titanium with IrO₂-Ta₂O₅ coating, more expensive but higher efficiency). 30-50 anodes per cell. Cathodes: stainless steel or titanium starter sheets (1m × 1m × 2mm), 30-50 cathodes interleaved with anodes, spacing 80-120mm. DC current: 200-350 A/m², 2.0-2.5V per cell, powered by rectifiers (AC to DC conversion). **Cathode reaction:** Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Ni (nickel plates onto cathode, metallic deposit). **Anode reaction:** 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ (oxygen gas evolves). Current efficiency: 90-95% (side reaction: hydrogen evolution 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂ at cathode 5-10%). Plating time: 5-7 days (nickel deposit grows to 8-12mm thick, 50-80 kg per cathode). [Electricity](electricity) consumption: 3.5-4.5 kWh per kg Ni (major operating cost). Nickel purity: 99.8-99.9% Ni (cathode grade).

**Step 79-92: Sulfide Ore Mining - Pentlandite**

[Sulfide ore](pentlandite-ore): pentlandite (Fe,Ni)₉S₈ (primary nickel sulfide, 34% Ni) associated with pyrrhotite Fe₁₋ₓS (iron sulfide), chalcopyrite CuFeS₂ (copper co-product), in ultramafic intrusions (komatiite, norite). Major deposits: Sudbury Basin Canada (world's largest, 1.6 Gt mined, Glencore, Vale operations), Norilsk-Talnakh Russia (Norilsk Nickel, permafrost mining, 2-5% Ni ore), Kambalda Australia, Jinchuan China, Voisey's Bay Canada. Underground mining: shaft sinking (1,000-2,500m depth), sublevel stoping or cut-and-fill methods, ore hoisting, ventilation critical (sulfide dust, radon gas, heat). Open-pit: where deposits near surface (Voisey's Bay, 1.5% Ni + 0.7% Cu). Ore composition: 0.5-5% Ni (average 1-2%), 0.3-2% Cu (valuable co-product), 30-45% Fe, 10-30% S, 0.005-0.02% platinum-group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh - extremely valuable byproducts, $30,000-80,000/kg, Sudbury/Norilsk major PGM sources).

**Step 93-108: Crushing, Grinding, and Flotation**

Crush ore: primary jaw crusher (1,000mm → 150mm), secondary cone crusher (150mm → 20mm), tertiary crushing (<10mm). Grind in [ball mill](grinding-mill) with water (30-45% solids slurry), grind to 80% passing 75 microns (fine liberation, separate sulfides from silicate gangue). **Flotation:** Feed slurry into [flotation cells](flotation-equipment) (mechanical agitation, air injection, 5-20m³ volume, 6-20 cells in series). Add [collectors](flotation-chemicals): xanthates (potassium amyl xanthate PAX, 50-150 g/tonne ore) selectively coat sulfide mineral surfaces (hydrophobic). Frothers: MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol, 20-50 g/tonne) stabilize air bubbles. pH control: lime addition to pH 9-11 (suppresses pyrite FeS₂ flotation, enhances pentlandite/chalcopyrite). Flotation kinetics: pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite attach to bubbles, float to surface froth (copper-nickel concentrate). Gangue (silicates, magnetite) sink to tailings. **Concentrate grade:** 8-15% Ni, 3-8% Cu, 30-45% S, 25-35% Fe. Recovery: 85-92% of nickel, 88-95% of copper. Dewater: thickeners + pressure filters (15-20% moisture). Concentrate production: 100 tonnes ore (1.5% Ni) → 12 tonnes concentrate (12% Ni), concentrate is 12% of original mass.

**Step 109-128: Flash Smelting - Matte Production**

Transport concentrate to smelter (Sudbury Canada: Vale/Glencore smelters; Norilsk Russia: Nadezhda smelter). Dry concentrate in rotary dryer or fluid bed (reduce moisture to <1%, 150-200°C). **[Flash furnace](flash-smelter):** Vertical or horizontal reaction shaft (10-20m tall, 4-8m diameter, refractory-lined), oxygen-enriched air (50-95% O₂ vs 21% in air) + concentrate powder injected at top. Combustion: sulfides combust in mid-air (flash smelting, particles oxidize exothermically). Reactions: 2(Ni,Fe)S + 3O₂ → 2(Ni,Fe)O + 2SO₂ + heat. Partial oxidation: (Ni,Fe)₉S₈ + xO₂ → (Ni,Fe)₉S₈₋ₓ + xSO₂ (controlled oxygen, avoid complete desulfurization, retain some sulfur). Temperature: 1,200-1,400°C (autogenous, exothermic reaction provides heat, minimal external fuel). Settler: molten material accumulates in furnace hearth, two layers separate by density. **Nickel matte (bottom layer):** 25-45% Ni, 20-40% Cu, 20-30% Fe, 18-25% S, density 5.0-5.5 g/cm³. Liquid at 1,100-1,300°C. Tap matte into ladles every 2-4 hours. **Slag (top layer):** iron silicate + magnetite (Fe₃O₄, FeO-SiO₂, 0.3-0.8% Ni, 0.2-0.5% Cu losses), 2.8-3.5 g/cm³. Tap separately, granulate with water, discard or sell (construction aggregate, abrasive). **SO₂ capture:** Off-gas contains 15-50% SO₂, clean in electrostatic precipitators (remove dust), convert to [sulfuric acid](sulfuric-acid) in contact process (2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃, SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄). Produces 1.5-2.5 tonnes H₂SO₄ per tonne Ni (byproduct revenue, environmental compliance). Modern plants capture >99% SO₂ (acid rain prevention).

**Step 129-145: Converting - High-Matte Production**

Remove iron and remaining sulfur from nickel matte. **Peirce-Smith converter:** Horizontal cylindrical furnace (4-5m diameter, 10-13m long, rotates on trunnions), tuyeres (copper nozzles) blow oxygen-enriched air (40-70% O₂) through molten matte. Charge converter with 60-100 tonnes flash furnace matte (liquid 1,200°C). **Slagging blow (first stage):** 4-8 hours, oxidize iron to FeO: 2Fe + O₂ → 2FeO. Add silica flux (SiO₂, quartz, 100-200 kg/tonne matte): 2FeO + SiO₂ → Fe₂SiO₃ (fayalite slag, liquid, floats on matte). Slag also contains Cu-Fe-S (some copper losses 2-5%). Skim slag periodically, return to flash furnace or discard. After slagging: converter matte (55-70% Ni + Cu, 20-25% S, <3% Fe). **Desulfurization blow (second stage):** 2-4 hours, oxidize sulfur: 2(Ni,Cu)S + 3O₂ → 2(Ni,Cu)O + 2SO₂. Nickel and copper oxides immediately reduce back to metal via sulfide remaining: (Ni,Cu)O + (Ni,Cu)S → 2(Ni,Cu) + SO₂. Progressive desulfurization: 25% S → 10% S → 2% S → <0.5% S (final). Product: Bessemer matte (75-78% Ni+Cu, 0.3-1.0% S, 0.5-1.5% Fe). Matte is brittle solid at room temperature (Ni-Cu-S-Fe alloy). Cast into molds (anodes for electrorefining or granules for leaching).

**Step 146-162: Nickel Separation from Copper - Roasting and Leaching**

Bessemer matte contains nickel + copper (approximately 60% Ni, 20% Cu, varies by ore). Separate using selective leaching. **Slow cooling:** Cast matte into molds, cool slowly over 24-48 hours (controlled furnace cooling, 1,000°C → 400°C at 10-20°C/hour). Promotes phase separation: high-nickel phase (heazlewoodite Ni₃S₂, 73% Ni) segregates from high-copper phase (chalcocite Cu₂S, 80% Cu) as discrete grains. **Crushing:** Crush cooled matte to <10mm (jaw crusher + roll crusher). **Magnetic separation (optional):** High-nickel phases slightly magnetic (ferromagnetic Ni), copper phases non-magnetic. Weak magnetic separator partially enriches nickel fraction. **Roasting:** Oxidize sulfur in fluidized bed roaster or multiple-hearth furnace (500-700°C, controlled air, 2-4 hours). Reactions: Ni₃S₂ + 2O₂ → 3NiO + 2SO₂ (nickel oxide). Cu₂S + O₂ → 2CuO + SO₂ (copper oxide). Partial roasting: retain 5-15% sulfur (full oxidation forms nickel sulfate NiSO₄ soluble, complicates separation). **Ammonia leaching:** Treat roasted matte with ammonia solution (NH₃ 10-20%, 40-80°C, 2-6 hours, atmospheric or pressure 2-5 bar). Copper dissolves: CuO + 4NH₃ + H₂O → Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ + 2OH⁻ (tetraamminecopper(II) ion, bright blue solution). Nickel oxide less soluble in ammonia: NiO + xNH₃ → Ni(NH₃)ₓ²⁺ (forms slowly, kinetic selectivity). Filter: copper-rich solution (pregnant leach liquor, 40-80 g/L Cu, 5-15 g/L Ni) separates from nickel-rich residue (solid, 65-75% Ni, 2-5% Cu).

**Step 163-178: Electrorefining - Pure Nickel Cathodes**

Final purification to 99.95-99.99% Ni using electrolysis. Cast nickel-rich material (high-nickel matte, Bessemer matte, or low-grade nickel) into anodes (300-500 kg each, 1m × 0.8m × 40mm, vertical plates). **[Electrorefining cell](electrorefining-cell):** Concrete tank lined with polymer (6m × 3m × 2m deep), 30-60 anodes + cathodes. Electrolyte: nickel sulfamate Ni(SO₃NH₂)₂ (180-220 g/L Ni, pH 3.5-4.5, 50-60°C) or nickel sulfate/chloride (NiSO₄ 80-100 g/L + NaCl 100-150 g/L, pH 2.5-3.5, 60-65°C). Sulfamate preferred (lower stress deposit, better physical properties). Cathodes: thin nickel starter sheets (1mm, pure Ni seed strips) or stainless steel blanks (peel off nickel later). Anode-cathode spacing: 80-120mm, interleaved (anode-cathode-anode-cathode pattern). DC current: 150-300 A/m², 2.5-3.5V per cell. **Anode reaction:** Ni (anode, impure) → Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻. Nickel dissolves, enters solution. Impurities: copper, iron, cobalt dissolve (stay in solution, controlled by electrolyte purification/bleed). Noble impurities (Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Se, Te from PGM-bearing sulfide ores) don't oxidize, fall as anode slime (valuable, recover by fire assay + solvent extraction, Sudbury/Norilsk slimes contain $500-2,000 PGM value per tonne anode). **Cathode reaction:** Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Ni (pure nickel plates onto cathode). Current efficiency: 92-97%. Plating time: 10-14 days (deposit thickness 10-15mm, 100-150 kg per cathode). Cathode nickel: 99.95-99.99% Ni (electrolytic nickel, Grade 1). Impurities: <0.005% Co, <0.002% Cu, <0.001% Fe, <0.0005% S, <50 ppm C.

**Step 179-195: Final Processing and Product Forms**

Remove cathodes, strip nickel sheet from starter or steel blank. **Briquetting:** Shear cathodes into strips (100mm × 50mm), compress in hydraulic press (form dense briquettes 10-30 kg, stackable, low surface area = minimal oxidation during storage). **Pellets:** Melt cathode nickel in electric arc furnace (1,500-1,600°C, inert atmosphere argon or nitrogen to prevent oxidation), pour molten stream through water jet atomization (break into droplets, rapid solidification forms spherical pellets 3-20mm diameter). Pellets for steelmaking (easy to add, rapid dissolution). **Powder:** Electrolytic decomposition (special low-density cathode deposit) or carbonyl process (Ni + 4CO → Ni(CO)₄ at 50°C, vapor phase, decompose at 200°C → Ni powder + 4CO, high purity 99.9-99.98% but energy-intensive, used for fine powder <10 microns for catalysts, batteries). **Rondelles:** Cast into small ingots 10-20 kg (almond-shaped, traditional LME good delivery form). **Testing:** Each lot analyzed by ICP-OES (impurities Ni, Co, Cu, Fe, C, S, Mn, Si, Mg, Al, Cr, P, Zn verified to specification). London Metal Exchange (LME) brands: Grade 1 nickel (99.80% min), Premium nickel (99.98%+ for batteries, electronics). **Packaging:** Briquettes/rondelles in steel drums (500 kg) or wooden crates (1-2 tonnes), shrink-wrapped pallets. Store dry (nickel oxidizes slowly in air forming green patina NiO, but not as rapid as copper). **Uses by form:** Briquettes/pellets → stainless steel (70-80% Ni, 10-20% Cr, balance Fe, austenitic 304/316 grades, global 50+ Mt stainless/year uses 2.3 Mt Ni). Powder → lithium-ion battery cathodes (NMC nickel-manganese-cobalt 811/622, NCA nickel-cobalt-aluminum, 500,000 tonnes Ni/year for EV batteries, growing 15-20%/year, long-term may exceed stainless demand). Shapes → superalloys (Inconel, Hastelloy, Ni 40-75% + Cr, Mo, Co, Al, Ti for jet engines, gas turbines, nuclear reactors, 200,000 tonnes/year). Electroplating → decorative/corrosion protection (bright nickel on steel taps, tools, 50,000 tonnes/year). Alloys → Cupronickel (70Cu-30Ni, marine piping, coins), Monel (67Ni-30Cu, corrosion-resistant), Permalloy (80Ni-20Fe, magnetic shielding), Nichrome (80Ni-20Cr, resistance heating wire). **Price:** $15,000-30,000/tonne (2010-2024 range, volatile), recent $18,000-22,000/tonne. Cost structure: mining/milling 35%, smelting 20%, refining 15%, energy (electricity 25-30%), labor 5%, other 5%. Energy: 50-80 kWh per kg Ni (laterite HPAL + electrowinning 55-75 kWh/kg, sulfide ore smelting + electrorefining 45-60 kWh/kg). Carbon footprint: 10-20 tonnes CO₂e per tonne Ni (laterite 12-20, sulfide 8-15, mainly energy + diesel mining + smelter fuel). Indonesian nickel (coal-fired HPAL + pyrometallurgy) high-carbon (15-25 t CO₂/t Ni), Canadian hydro-powered refineries low-carbon (6-12 t CO₂/t Ni). Recycling: stainless steel scrap recycled (40% of stainless production from scrap, nickel recovered in electric arc furnace), batteries (emerging, <10% recycled currently but scaling rapidly for EV battery EOL management).
