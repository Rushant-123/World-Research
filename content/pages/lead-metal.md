- [Doe Run](/companies/doe-run)



Lead (Pb) is a heavy, soft, malleable metal extracted from galena ore (PbS) through flotation concentration, sintering, blast furnace smelting, and pyrometallurgical refining. Primary uses: lead-acid batteries (85% of consumption), radiation shielding, ammunition, cable sheathing. Global production: 12 million tonnes/year.

## What is it?

Pure lead metal (99.94-99.99% Pb) produced through primary smelting of galena concentrate or recycling of lead-acid batteries. Lead properties: density 11.34 g/cm³, melting point 327°C, soft and ductile, excellent radiation/sound attenuation, corrosion resistant. Major producers: China (45%), USA (7%), India (6%), Australia (6%). 50% of supply from recycled lead (highest recycling rate of any metal).

## Steps to Make:

**Lead Ore Geology and Mining:**
1. Lead mineral: galena (PbS, 86.6% Pb), occurs in hydrothermal veins, sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) deposits, Mississippi Valley type (MVT) deposits
2. Associated minerals: sphalerite (ZnS), pyrite (FeS₂), chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂), silver (100-5,000 ppm Ag in galena)
3. Ore grades: primary lead mines 3-10% Pb, polymetallic deposits 1-5% Pb + 2-8% Zn + 50-300 g/t Ag
4. Major deposits: Red Dog (Alaska, SEDEX), Mount Isa (Australia, SEDEX), Viburnum Trend (Missouri, MVT), Broken Hill (Australia)
5. Mining methods: underground (>80% of lead mines) - cut-and-fill, room-and-pillar, sublevel stoping for vein and massive sulfide ores
6. Open pit mining: large disseminated deposits, bench heights 10-15m, haul trucks 100-300 tonnes capacity
7. Mine [Galena Ore](galena-ore) by drill-and-blast: blast holes 75-150mm diameter, ANFO explosive (ammonium nitrate-fuel oil)

**Crushing and Grinding:**
8. Transport ore to processing plant via haul trucks or conveyor systems
9. Primary crushing: jaw crusher or gyratory crusher reduces ROM (run-of-mine) ore from 1m to 150-300mm
10. Secondary crushing: cone crusher reduces to 20-50mm, closed-circuit with vibrating screen
11. Screen oversize returns to crusher (recirculating load), undersize proceeds to grinding
12. SAG mill (semi-autogenous grinding): rotating cylinder 8-12m diameter, ore grinds itself + 8-15% steel balls
13. Ball mill: 4-6m diameter, filled 30-40% with steel balls (30-100mm), grinds to liberation size
14. Target grind: 70-85% passing 75 microns (200 mesh), liberates galena crystals from gangue minerals
15. Cyclone classifiers: separate ground ore into size fractions, coarse returns to mill, fine to flotation
16. Grinding circuit operates in closed loop: optimizes energy efficiency, typical throughput 500-5,000 tonnes ore per day

**Froth Flotation - Lead Separation:**
17. Pump ground ore slurry (30-40% solids) to flotation circuits
18. Lead flotation: differential flotation separates lead, zinc, and pyrite sequentially
19. Add chemical collectors: xanthates (potassium ethyl xanthate KEX, 30-80 g/tonne) - coat galena surfaces, make hydrophobic
20. Frother: MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol, 10-30 g/tonne) - stabilizes air bubbles, creates froth
21. pH control: lime (CaO) addition maintains pH 9-11, depresses pyrite and sphalerite
22. Rougher flotation cells: large mechanically-agitated cells 50-300 m³, air injection from bottom
23. Galena particles (hydrophobic) attach to air bubbles, float to surface as froth
24. Skim froth containing galena concentrate, gangue minerals (silica, carbonates) sink as tailings
25. Rougher concentrate: 15-30% Pb, 10-20% Zn, 20-30% S (mixed sulfides)
26. Cleaner flotation: re-float rougher concentrate 2-3 times, removes remaining gangue and zinc
27. Final lead concentrate: 60-75% Pb, 1-5% Zn, 10-15% S, 1,000-5,000 g/t Ag (silver reports with lead)
28. Zinc depressants: sodium cyanide (NaCN, 0.2-0.8 kg/tonne) or zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) - depress sphalerite, enhance Pb-Zn separation
29. Lead recovery: 90-95% of lead in ore reports to concentrate
30. Concentrate thickening: settle concentrate slurry in thickener, increase solids to 65-75%
31. Filter concentrate: pressure filters or vacuum drum filters, reduce moisture to 8-10%
32. Store dried concentrate in covered shed, prevent spontaneous combustion (sulfides oxidize exothermically)

**Concentrate Roasting (Optional Pre-treatment):**
33. Some smelters roast concentrate to partially oxidize sulfur before sintering
34. Fluidized bed roaster: fine concentrate suspended in upward air stream at 600-900°C
35. Partial roasting reactions: 2PbS + 3O₂ → 2PbO + 2SO₂, PbS + 2O₂ → PbSO₄
36. Product: calcine containing PbO (lead oxide), PbSO₄ (lead sulfate), unreacted PbS (20-40%)
37. SO₂ off-gas: 8-14% concentration, sent to sulfuric acid plant
38. Calcine easier to sinter than raw concentrate, reduces SO₂ emissions in sintering step

**Sintering - Agglomeration and Partial Oxidation:**
39. Receive lead concentrate (or calcine) from flotation plant or roaster
40. Blend concentrates from multiple mines to achieve consistent chemistry: target 55-70% Pb, <3% Zn
41. [Sintering Machine](dwight-lloyd-sinter): Dwight-Lloyd moving grate, 3-4m wide × 40-60m long
42. Mix concentrate with: 15-20% return fines (recycled undersized sinter), 5-8% [Limestone Flux](limestone) (CaCO₃), 3-5% [Coke](metallurgical-coke) breeze (fuel)
43. Limestone flux: reacts with silica and iron to form low-melting slag
44. Pelletize mixture with 6-8% water in drum mixer, forms green pellets 5-20mm
45. Spread pelletized mixture 300-500mm deep on moving grate (sintering strand)
46. Ignition hood: natural gas burners ignite top surface at 1,000-1,100°C
47. Downdraft sintering: draw air through bed from below using induced draft fans, creates 5-10 kPa vacuum
48. Combustion front propagates downward at 15-30 mm/minute, residence time 20-30 minutes
49. Coke combustion: C + O₂ → CO₂ (exothermic, releases 394 kJ/mol), heats material to 1,200-1,400°C
50. Sulfide oxidation: 2PbS + 3O₂ → 2PbO + 2SO₂ (exothermic, releases 828 kJ/mol)
51. High temperature causes partial melting, particles fuse together (sintering)
52. Lead sulfide converts to lead oxide (PbO), zinc partially volatilizes as ZnO vapor (captured in baghouse)
53. Limestone decomposes: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (at >900°C), CaO acts as flux
54. Slag formation: CaO + SiO₂ → CaSiO₃, FeO + SiO₂ → FeSiO₃ (low-melting phases bind particles)
55. Product: porous sinter cake discharged at end of strand onto crusher
56. Break sinter with single-roll crusher into 20-80mm lumps
57. Screen sinter: +10mm fraction to blast furnace, -10mm fines recycled to sinter mix
58. Sinter composition: 30-50% Pb as PbO, 15-20% SiO₂, 10-15% CaO, 10-15% FeO, 5-8% S (residual sulfide)
59. Sinter strength: 80-120 kg compressive strength, must support burden in blast furnace without disintegrating

**Off-Gas Treatment:**
60. SO₂ off-gas from sintering: 4-12% SO₂, 10-15% O₂, balance N₂, temperature 100-200°C
61. Dust collection: baghouse filters capture particulate (zinc oxide, lead oxide fume) - dust returns to sinter feed
62. SO₂ scrubbing: send gas to sulfuric acid plant (contact process)
63. Acid plant: oxidize SO₂ to SO₃ with vanadium catalyst at 420-620°C, absorb in 98% H₂SO₄
64. Yield: 2-3 tonnes sulfuric acid per tonne of lead produced (valuable byproduct, sold to fertilizer, chemical industries)
65. Modern smelters capture >99% of SO₂ (regulations require <0.1% SO₂ emissions)

**Blast Furnace Smelting - Reduction to Metallic Lead:**
66. [Blast Furnace](lead-blast-furnace): vertical shaft furnace, 3-4m internal diameter × 15-20m tall (smaller than iron blast furnace)
67. Refractory lining: firebrick or castable refractory, 300-500mm thick, resist slag corrosion and thermal shock
68. Water-cooled copper jackets in hearth zone: prevent refractory failure from intense heat and lead attack
69. Charge blast furnace from top via skip hoist or conveyor: loads dumped in 5-10 minute intervals
70. Burden composition: 40-50% sinter, 15-20% lump concentrate (unsinted), 12-18% coke, 8-12% limestone flux, 5-10% recycled slag/dross
71. Burden descends by gravity as lower material melts and is tapped
72. Coke: provides fuel (combustion heat) and reducing agent (carbon monoxide), consumption 150-250 kg per tonne of lead
73. Inject preheated air (blast) at 400-600°C through tuyeres at furnace base, 6-12 tuyeres around circumference
74. Oxygen enrichment: enrich blast to 25-35% O₂ (vs 21% in air) using [Oxygen Gas](oxygen-gas) from ASU (air separation unit)
75. Oxygen enrichment benefits: increases combustion temperature, reduces coke consumption, boosts productivity
76. Blast flow rate: 5,000-15,000 Nm³/hour depending on furnace size, blast pressure 1.2-2.0 bar gauge

**Blast Furnace Reactions:**
77. Tuyere combustion zone: C + O₂ → CO₂ (carbon burns, releases heat, temperature 1,400-1,600°C)
78. Boudouard reaction: CO₂ + C → 2CO (endothermic, consumes heat, produces reducing gas CO)
79. Lead oxide reduction begins at 400-500°C in upper shaft: PbO + CO → Pb + CO₂
80. Reduction reactions also: PbO + C → Pb + CO (direct reduction at higher temperatures)
81. Lead sulfide reduction: PbS + 2CO → Pb + 2COS (carbonyl sulfide), or PbS + C → Pb + CS₂
82. Metallic lead produced melts at 327°C, drips down through coke bed as liquid droplets
83. Iron reduction: FeO + CO → Fe + CO₂, some metallic iron forms (dissolves in slag or lead)
84. Zinc oxide (from sinter) partially reduces: ZnO + CO → Zn + CO₂, zinc vapor exits with top gas (captured as oxide in scrubbers)
85. Temperature profile in furnace: 1,500°C at tuyere level, 900°C mid-shaft, 300-400°C at top
86. Lead bullion collects in hearth (bottom crucible), density 11.3 g/cm³, temperature 900-1,100°C
87. Slag floats on bullion: lower density 3.0-3.5 g/cm³, consists of iron silicate (FeSiO₃), calcium silicate (CaSiO₃), alumina
88. Slag composition: 25-35% SiO₂, 15-25% FeO, 15-20% CaO, 5-10% Al₂O₃, 8-15% ZnO, <1% PbO (good lead recovery)
89. Bullion composition: 95-98% Pb, 0.5-2.5% Sb (antimony), 0.2-1.0% As (arsenic), 0.1-0.5% Cu, 0.05-0.2% Sn, 0.5-2.0% Ag (silver), traces Bi, Au

**Tapping and Casting:**
90. Tap bullion every 4-6 hours from taphole at hearth bottom
91. Taphole: 50-80mm diameter opening, drill open with pneumatic drill, plug with clay after tapping
92. Bullion flows into 10-20 tonne capacity ladles (refractory-lined steel)
93. Measure bullion temperature: 950-1,050°C typical (pyrometer)
94. Transfer ladle to refining kettles or cast into storage pigs (25-50 kg ingots)
95. Tap slag separately from slag notch 40-60 cm above metal level, continuous or batch tapping
96. Granulate slag: pour into water stream, forms glassy granules used as cement additive or road base
97. Blast furnace productivity: 100-400 tonnes lead bullion per day depending on furnace size
98. Lead recovery: 96-98% of lead in feed reports to bullion, 1-2% to slag, 1% to dust/fume

**Top Gas Treatment:**

100. Dust-laden: contains zinc oxide, lead oxide, iron oxide fume (10-50 g/Nm³ dust loading)
101. Cool gas in waste heat boiler: generate 1-2 MPa steam, recover thermal energy
102. Cyclone separators: remove coarse dust (>10 µm)
103. Baghouse filters: capture fine dust (<10 µm), dust contains 30-50% Zn, 10-20% Pb - send to zinc fuming or Imperial Smelting furnace
104. Scrub gas with water or caustic: remove H₂S, residual SO₂, particulates
105. CO-rich gas: combust in boiler for process heat (alternative: recover CO for chemical synthesis, uncommon)

**Pyrometallurgical Refining - Drossing:**
106. Transfer molten bullion (950-1,050°C) from blast furnace to [Refining Kettles](pyrometallurgical-refining): cast iron or steel vessels, 30-80 tonnes capacity
107. Cool bullion to 750-850°C, maintain stirring with rotating impeller or rabbling (manual stirring with iron bars)
108. Inject air or oxygen onto melt surface: oxidize copper, antimony, arsenic, iron (form dross - mixture of oxides)
109. Copper oxidation: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO, forms black dross floating on melt surface
110. Antimony oxidation: 4Sb + 3O₂ → 2Sb₂O₃ (white antimony oxide), volatilizes partially, some forms dross
111. Arsenic oxidation: 4As + 3O₂ → 2As₂O₃ (arsenious oxide, volatile, toxic - captured in fume hood)
112. Add sulfur powder (0.5-1.5% by weight): reacts with copper to form CuS (copper sulfide), improves dross separation
113. Skim dross from surface with perforated ladles, dross composition: 30-50% Cu, 10-25% Sb, 5-15% As, 20-30% Pb, 3-8% Ag
114. Dross accumulation: 2-5% of bullion weight, sent to copper smelter or slag fuming for metal recovery
115. Hold at 750°C for 2-4 hours, repeat air injection and skimming until Cu <0.005%, Sb <0.05%, As <0.02%
116. Test samples by fire assay or XRF (X-ray fluorescence) for impurity levels

**Softening - Removal of Antimony and Arsenic:**
117. Further cool bullion to 550-650°C after drossing
118. Add [Natural Gas](natural-gas) or inject propane: creates reducing atmosphere (CO, H₂)
119. Antimony and arsenic volatilize as elements or sub-oxides at 550-650°C under reducing conditions
120. Antimony: vapor pressure increases with temperature, sublimates as Sb vapor or Sb₂O₃
121. Arsenic: As₂O₃ vapor (bp 465°C) volatilizes readily
122. Capture volatilized Sb and As in fume collection system (baghouse), dust contains 30-60% Sb, 10-30% As
123. Antimony and arsenic dust: valuable byproduct, sold to antimony refiners (antimony used in flame retardants, lead-acid battery grids)
124. Alternatively: add molten caustic soda (NaOH) at 550-600°C, forms sodium antimonite (Na₃SbO₃) and sodium arsenite (Na₃AsO₃) slag
125. Skim caustic slag from surface, regenerate NaOH for reuse
126. Softening endpoint: Sb <0.005%, As <0.001%, takes 3-6 hours depending on batch size and initial impurity levels
127. Product: "softened lead" - still contains silver (0.5-2.0% Ag), must be desilverized

**Desilverization - Parkes Process:**
128. Cool softened lead to 500-520°C in kettle, maintain gentle stirring
129. Add molten zinc metal: 1.5-2.0% by weight of bullion (e.g., 1,000 kg Zn per 50 tonnes Pb)
130. Zinc and lead are immiscible liquids at 500°C, form two phases
131. Silver solubility in zinc at 500°C: 300× higher than in lead (thermodynamic partition coefficient)
132. Gold also partitions strongly to zinc phase
133. Stir vigorously for 45-90 minutes: high-speed paddle 60-100 RPM, disperses zinc droplets throughout lead
134. Silver transfers from lead to zinc phase by diffusion: Ag(in Pb) → Ag(in Zn)
135. Stop stirring, allow phases to separate by gravity over 2-4 hours
136. Zinc floats to surface: lower density 6.6 g/cm³ vs lead 10.7 g/cm³ at 500°C
137. Cool slowly to 370-390°C over 6-12 hours: zinc-silver crust solidifies at surface
138. Zinc crust composition: 8-15% Ag, 0.1-0.5% Au, 10-20% Pb (dissolved in zinc), balance Zn
139. Skim crust with mechanical skimmer or hand rakes, yield 2-4 tonnes crust per 50 tonnes bullion
140. Residual lead: now contains 0.05-0.15% Ag (first Parkes pass removes 50-85% of silver)

**Second and Third Parkes Treatments:**
141. Reheat desilverized lead to 500°C, add fresh zinc 1.0-1.5% by weight
142. Repeat stirring, settling, and skimming (second Parkes treatment)
143. Second crust: 5-10% Ag, lower grade than first crust
144. Third treatment: add 0.5-1.0% zinc, reduces lead to <0.005% Ag (specification for commercial soft lead)
145. Combine all crusts: store in drums for zinc retorting (vacuum distillation to remove zinc, recover silver-gold alloy)
146. Final desilverized lead (soft lead): 99.94-99.97% Pb, <0.005% Ag, <0.005% Cu, <0.005% Sb, <0.001% As

153. At anode: Pb → Pb²⁺ + 2e⁻ (lead dissolves into electrolyte)
154. At cathode: Pb²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Pb (pure lead plates onto cathode)
155. Impurities: Cu, Ag, Au, Bi do not dissolve (fall as anode slime), As, Sb, Sn may dissolve but removed by bleeding electrolyte
156. Current efficiency: 90-95%, refining time 5-10 days
157. Cathode lead: 99.99-99.999% Pb (four-nines to five-nines purity)
158. Applications: radiation shielding (medical, nuclear), semiconductor industry, superconducting alloys, crystal glass

**Melting and Casting Final Lead Products:**
159. Transfer refined lead (soft or electrolytic) to holding furnace: gas-fired or electric, 20-100 tonnes capacity
160. Maintain temperature 400-500°C (above lead melting point 327°C, below excessive oxidation)
161. Skim dross: thin oxide film (PbO) forms on surface, remove before casting
162. Add grain refining agents if needed: 0.01-0.05% calcium or rare earth metals (reduce grain size, improve mechanical properties)
163. Cast into product forms via automated casting machines:
164. Ingots: 25-50 kg pigs (trapezoidal blocks), stamp with producer mark, weight, purity
165. LBMA Good Delivery lead ingots: 25-50 kg, 99.97% Pb minimum

170. Extrusion: ram lead billets through die to produce pipes, tubes, profiles

**Quality Control and Testing:**
171. Sample each casting batch: drill samples from ingots or take dross samples
172. Fire assay: for silver content in lead (important for precious metal accounting)
173. ICP-OES or ICP-MS: measure all impurities (Cu, Sb, As, Sn, Zn, Bi, Ag, Fe, each typically <10 ppm for high-purity lead)
