# How to Make Fused Silica (SiO₂)

Amorphous (glassy) silicon dioxide - thermal and chemical stability, low thermal expansion, optical clarity. Uses: semiconductor molding compound filler (70-90% by weight), investment casting shells, refractory linings, optical components, quartz glass. Annual production: 3-5 million tonnes (mostly for molding compound, refractories).

**Step 1-15: [High-Purity Quartz](quartz-mining) Mining**
Source: high-purity quartz deposits (>99.9% SiO₂). Occurrence: pegmatites (coarse-grained igneous intrusions), hydrothermal vein quartz, quartzite (metamorphic). Key deposits: Spruce Pine, North Carolina (USA, premier source, 99.98-99.995% SiO₂), Brazil (Minas Gerais), Norway (Drag). Impurities critical: aluminum (100-500 ppm), iron (10-50 ppm), titanium (5-20 ppm), alkalis (Li, Na, K total <50 ppm), transition metals (Cr, Mn, Cu <5 ppm each). Lower impurities → higher value (semiconductors require ultra-low metals). Mining: underground or open pit, selective mining (hand-sort visual-grade quartz crystals), drill-blast-load-haul. Ore: massive quartz veins, 1-10 meter thick, white to clear crystals. Grade: 95-99% SiO₂ as mined (gangue: feldspars, micas, clays).

**Step 16-32: Crushing, Grinding, and Beneficiation**
Jaw crusher: 1,000mm → 150mm. Cone crusher: 150mm → 25mm. Screen to -25mm. Scrubbing: attrition scrubber (high-speed impeller in water, 1,200 rpm, 15-30 minutes) removes clay coatings, surface oxidation. Magnetic separation: wet high-intensity magnetic separator (WHIMS, 1.5-2.0 Tesla) removes magnetite, ilmenite, hematite (iron minerals, magnetic susceptibility >10⁻⁶ SI). Rotary drum with permanent magnets or electromagnets. Non-magnetic quartz passes through (Fe reduced to 50-100 ppm). Flotation: quartz floats with cationic collectors (amine acetate, dodecylamine, pH 2-3, HCl or H₂SO₄ acidify). Feldspar and mica depress with HF (hydrofluoric acid, 0.1-0.5 kg/tonne) - selectively etches Al-silicates, prevents flotation. Quartz concentrate: 99.5-99.8% SiO₂. Further purification: acid leaching (heat in 10-30% HCl at 80-100°C for 2-12 hours, dissolves residual iron, aluminum). Rinse, filter, dry at 150°C. Final quartz: 99.9-99.99% SiO₂, Fe <50 ppm, Al <200 ppm.

**Step 33-50: Fusion in [Electric Arc Furnace](arc-furnace)**
Fuse quartz by melting at 1,700-2,000°C (SiO₂ melting point 1,710°C). [Electric arc furnace](arc-furnace) (EAF): three graphite electrodes (400-600mm diameter) strike arcs to charge (molten pool 50-100 tonnes). Power: 5-15 MW. Charge: lumps of high-purity quartz (50-200mm size), continuously feed. Quartz melts, viscous liquid (10⁶ Pa·s at 1,800°C). No flux added (maintain purity). Reducing atmosphere (CO from graphite electrodes + trace carbon) prevents SiO₂ reduction to Si (unwanted). Temperature control: adjust electrode position, power input. Residence time: 2-4 hours. Molten silica: water-white (clear) if ultra-pure, amber if iron-contaminated. Tap molten silica into water bath (quench) - thermal shock shatters into angular chunks 10-100mm (rapid cooling locks in amorphous structure, prevents devitrification). Alternative tap: pour onto steel plate, cool slowly, crush mechanically. Product: fused silica chunks, random size 5-150mm, bulk density 1.2-1.5 g/cm³ (vs crystalline quartz 2.65 g/cm³ - lower due to amorphous structure and air voids).

**Step 51-68: Flame Fusion for Spherical Silica**
Produce spherical fused silica particles (better flow in molding compound, higher packing density). [Flame fusion process](hydrogen-flame): feed high-purity quartz powder (<100 µm) into oxy-hydrogen flame (2,800-3,000°C). Particles melt in flight (dwell time milliseconds), surface tension forms spheres, quench in air or water below flame. Collect spherical beads 1-100 µm diameter. Particle size controlled by feed rate, flame temperature, powder size. Sphericity: >95% (diameter_max / diameter_min). Alternative: plasma torch (argon plasma, 5,000-10,000 K, higher throughput, 100-1,000 kg/hour). Another method: sol-gel (tetraethyl orthosilicate TEOS hydrolyze → silica gel spheres, dry, sinter at 1,200°C). Sol-gel: expensive but ultra-high purity, used for optics.

**Step 69-85: [Grinding and Milling](ball-mill)**
Grind fused silica chunks to powder. Jaw crusher: 100mm → 10mm. [Ball mill](ball-mill): horizontal cylinder (2-5m diameter, 3-8m long) rotates 15-25 rpm. Grinding media: high-purity alumina balls (99.5-99.9% Al₂O₃, 25-50mm diameter, avoid steel media - contaminates with Fe), or silica pebbles (natural quartz, iron-free). Charge: 30-40% balls by volume, 20-30% silica by volume, remainder air or water (wet milling). Wet milling: silica + water slurry (50-60% solids). Mill 6-24 hours. Product size distribution: d₅₀ = 5-30 µm (median particle size). Overgrind risk: amorphous silica etches slowly in water (dissolves as silicic acid Si(OH)₄, 100-120 ppm solubility at pH 7), generates fine slimes (<1 µm). Drain slurry, de-water in thickener or filter press. Dry in rotary or fluid bed dryer at 150-200°C to <0.1% moisture.

**Step 86-102: [Classification](air-classifier) and Size Separation**
Separate powder into size fractions. **Air classification:** Zig-zag classifier or turbo classifier. Feed powder in air stream, centrifugal force separates by particle density and size. Heavy/coarse particles exit bottom, fine particles exit with air stream (cyclone separator recovers). Adjust air velocity to cut point: 5 µm, 10 µm, 20 µm, 40 µm (common grades). **Sieving:** vibratory sieves with woven wire mesh or electroformed screens. Mesh sizes: 325 mesh (44 µm), 400 mesh (37 µm), 500 mesh (25 µm). Throughput: 50-500 kg/hour depending on fineness. Achieve narrow particle size distributions (PSDs). Example: d₁₀ = 2 µm, d₅₀ = 10 µm, d₉₀ = 25 µm (90% of particles between 2-25 µm). Molding compound requires bimodal distribution: 30% fine (1-5 µm) + 70% coarse (10-30 µm) for maximum packing density (75-85% by volume).

**Step 103-118: Surface Treatment**
Silica surface: silanol groups (Si-OH), hydrophilic (water-attracting), poor compatibility with organic epoxy resin. Surface treatment improves resin wetting, reduces viscosity, enhances mechanical properties of cured composite. **Silane coupling agent:** 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) most common. Structure: epoxy group (reacts with epoxy resin) + silane group (bonds to silica). Process: dilute silane in alcohol-water (0.5-2% solution, pH 4-5 acetic acid). Spray onto silica in mixer (ribbon blender, paddle mixer) while agitating. Silane hydrolyzes: Si-OCH₃ + H₂O → Si-OH + CH₃OH. Condenses with surface silanol: Surface-Si-OH + HO-Si-R → Surface-Si-O-Si-R + H₂O (siloxane bond, covalent attachment). Dry treated silica at 110-130°C for 2-4 hours (completes condensation, removes moisture). Silane loading: 0.5-2% by weight of silica. Measure by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) - organic content burns off at 400-600°C.

**Step 119-133: Quality Control and Specifications**
**Purity:** ICP-MS or ICP-OES for trace metals. Semiconductor-grade molding compound filler: SiO₂ >99.9%, Fe <10 ppm, Al <50 ppm, alkalis (Na+K) <10 ppm, transition metals (Cu, Cr, Ni) each <5 ppm, U+Th (radioactive, alpha particle emitters cause soft errors in chips) each <1 ppb. **Particle size:** Laser diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer, Horiba). Volume-weighted distribution d₁₀, d₅₀, d₉₀. Spec: d₅₀ = 15 ± 3 µm typical for molding compound. **Specific surface area:** BET nitrogen adsorption. Fine silica (5 µm): 1-5 m²/g. Coarse silica (25 µm): 0.2-0.5 m²/g. **Moisture:** Karl Fischer titration or loss on drying (LOD). Spec: <0.1% (moisture causes voids during molding, popcorning during reflow). **Silane treatment:** TGA measures organic content. FTIR verifies silane structure (C-H stretch 2,900 cm⁻¹, epoxy 910 cm⁻¹). **Crystalline silica:** X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fused silica: broad amorphous hump (no sharp peaks). Crystalline quartz: sharp peaks at 2θ = 20.9°, 26.7°, 50.2°. Spec: <0.5% crystalline (respirable crystalline silica causes silicosis, occupational hazard, OSHA PEL 0.05 mg/m³).

**Step 134-145: Fused Silica Properties**
**Amorphous structure:** atoms lack long-range order (random network, SiO₄ tetrahedra corner-sharing). **Thermal properties:** Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE): 0.5-0.6 ppm/°C (25-200°C range, extremely low - silicon is 2.6 ppm/°C, copper 17 ppm/°C). Low CTE critical for molding compound (minimizes package stress, prevents cracking during temperature cycling). Softening point: 1,580°C. Thermal conductivity: 1.3-1.4 W/m·K at 25°C (vs crystalline quartz 6-7 W/m·K - amorphous structure scatters phonons). **Optical:** Transparent UV to near-IR (200-2,500 nm). Refractive index: 1.46 at 589 nm. High-purity grades (low OH, low metal) transmit deep UV (193 nm for lithography optics). **Chemical:** Resistant to acids except HF. Alkalis (NaOH, KOH) attack rapidly (dissolve as silicate). Thermal SiO₂ (grown on silicon wafer): etch rate 100 Å/min in 1% HF at 25°C. **Dielectric:** Dielectric constant 3.8 at 1 MHz (low, favorable for electronics). Dielectric strength 10-15 kV/mm. Volume resistivity >10¹⁶ Ω·cm (excellent insulator).

**Step 146-155: Applications in Semiconductor Packaging**
**Molding compound:** epoxy resin 15-20%, fused silica filler 70-85%, additives 5-10%. Filler functions: (1) CTE reduction (epoxy 50-80 ppm/°C → filled compound 15-25 ppm/°C, matched to silicon die and substrate). (2) Strength (increases tensile and flexural strength 2-3×). (3) Cost reduction (silica $0.3-1/kg vs epoxy $2-4/kg, lowers formulation cost). (4) Thermal conductivity (filler improves 2-3× vs unfilled). (5) Moisture barrier (reduces moisture absorption 2-5×). High filler loading (80-85%) requires bimodal PSD and surface treatment (achieve acceptable viscosity <1,000 Pa·s at 175°C molding temperature). Spiral flow test: 100-150 cm for good moldability. **Substrate/PCB:** FR-4 laminates use E-glass fiber (30%) + epoxy (30%) + silica filler (30-40%) to improve dimensional stability, reduce warpage. **Thermal interface materials:** silicone filled with silica (10-50%) for gap filling between chip and heat sink. **Underfill:** capillary underfill (liquid epoxy wicked under flip-chip die, cures, mechanically supports solder bumps) uses fine silica (1-5 µm, 50-70% loading) to lower CTE and control flow.

**Step 156-165: Market and Economics**
Fused silica production: 3-5 million tonnes/year. Molding compound filler: 60-70% (2-3.5 Mt), refractories 15-20% (crucibles, kiln linings), investment casting 10-15% (aerospace/dental casting shells), other 5-10% (adhesives, coatings, optical materials). Price: $0.30-1.50/kg depending on purity and particle size. Standard molding compound grade (99.5% SiO₂, 15 µm median): $0.30-0.50/kg. High-purity grade (99.9%, low alpha): $0.80-1.50/kg. Quartz glass (optical grade, ultra-low OH): $20-100/kg (specialty). Suppliers: Sibelco (Belgium, global leader), Quartz Corp (US-Norway joint venture, Spruce Pine mine), US Silica, Denka (Japan), China Non-Metallic Minerals (CNMC). Trade: high-purity quartz concentrated in few sources (Spruce Pine ~50% of semiconductor-grade quartz globally, supply chain risk). China: large domestic production but quality variable (higher impurities, 99.0-99.5% vs 99.9% for Spruce Pine).

Price: $0.30/kg represents standard fused silica filler for molding compound. Used at 70-85% by weight in epoxy molding compound. Chip package: 0.5-2g molding compound (BGA, QFN, SOIC depending on size) → 0.35-1.7g silica per package → $0.0001-0.0005 per package. In supply chain context, silica is critical but low-cost component (dominates mass, small fraction of cost vs metals, processing).
