# How to Make Aluminum Oxide (Al₂O₃)

Alumina - intermediate between bauxite ore and aluminum metal. Also: ceramics, abrasives, refractories, catalysts, sapphire substrates. Global production: 140 million tonnes/year (90% metallurgical-grade for aluminum smelting, 10% specialty grades). Bayer process: chemical extraction from bauxite ore.

**Step 1-15: [Bauxite Ore](bauxite-mining) Mining and Composition**
Bauxite: aluminum ore, mixture of aluminum hydroxide minerals. Gibbsite Al(OH)₃ (most common, 65% Al₂O₃ equivalent), boehmite AlO(OH) (62% Al₂O₃), diaspore AlO(OH) (85% Al₂O₃, hard, high-temperature polymorph). Bauxite composition: 40-60% Al₂O₃, 12-30% Fe₂O₃ (iron oxide, "red mud" impurity), 1-15% SiO₂ (silica, reactive impurity, consumes caustic), 2-10% TiO₂ (titanium dioxide), 10-30% H₂O (bound water in hydroxides). Quality metric: silica modulus SM = Al₂O₃/SiO₂ (mass ratio, prefer SM >7, high-silica ore SM 3-6 requires more caustic, less economical). Deposits: laterite weathering of aluminum-rich rocks in tropical climates (Guinea, Australia, Brazil, Jamaica, India, China). Open-pit mining: draglines, shovels, trucks (similar to phosphate/copper mining). Production: 380 Mt bauxite/year → 140 Mt alumina (2.7:1 ratio).

**Step 16-35: Crushing, Grinding, and Slurry Preparation**
Crush bauxite: jaw crusher (1,000mm → 100mm), hammer mill (100mm → 10mm). Wet grinding: rod mill or ball mill with [caustic solution](caustic-soda) (sodium hydroxide NaOH, 150-300 g/L, preheated to 80-100°C). Grind to 90% passing 150 µm (wet milling, 40-50% solids slurry). Grinding aids dispersion, increases surface area for chemical reaction. Slurry: bauxite + caustic + recycled process liquor (pregnant liquor from previous batches, contains dissolved Na₂O-Al₂O₃-H₂O sodium aluminate). Preheat slurry: heat exchangers, 100-150°C (recover heat from digestion, energy integration).

**Step 36-58: Digestion in [High-Pressure Digesters](digester-tanks)**
Bayer process core reaction: Al(OH)₃ + NaOH → NaAlO₂ + 2H₂O (alumina dissolves as sodium aluminate). Gibbsite dissolves at 140-150°C, boehmite requires 200-250°C (higher temperature, higher pressure). **Digesters:** Pressure vessels (carbon steel, 10-50 m³ capacity), horizontal or vertical, steam-jacketed or direct steam injection. Operating: 3-10 bar pressure (saturated steam temperature), 140-250°C (depending on bauxite mineralogy), residence time 30-90 minutes. Caustic concentration: 150-300 g/L Na₂O (as NaOH equivalent), A/C ratio (Al₂O₃/Na₂O caustic ratio) 0.5-0.7 (stoichiometric balance, excess caustic ensures complete dissolution). Feed slurry continuously or batch, heat rapidly to digestion temperature. Reactions: (1) Alumina extraction: Al(OH)₃ + NaOH → Na[Al(OH)₄] or NaAlO₂ + 2H₂O. Boehmite and diaspore: AlO(OH) + NaOH + H₂O → Na[Al(OH)₄]. (2) Silica reaction (desilication, unwanted): SiO₂ + 2NaOH → Na₂SiO₃ + H₂O (sodium silicate). Then: Na₂SiO₃ + 2NaAlO₂ → Na₂O·Al₂O₃·2SiO₂·2H₂O (sodalite or cancrinite, insoluble sodium aluminosilicate, precipitates, caustic loss). High-silica bauxite: 0.5-1.5 kg NaOH lost per kg SiO₂ (major cost, prefer low-silica ores). (3) Iron, titanium: Fe₂O₃, TiO₂ insoluble, remain as solids ("red mud"). Discharge digested slurry (pregnant liquor + solids).

**Step 59-78: Settling and Clarification**
Separate dissolved aluminate (pregnant liquor) from insoluble residue (red mud). **Gravity settling:** Thickeners (20-100m diameter, conical bottom), slurry enters center, solids settle (24-48 hours residence), clear liquor overflows edge, underflow (thickened mud 30-50% solids) from bottom. Flocculants: polyacrylamide (0.05-0.2 kg/tonne solids, aids settling, forms large flocs 1-10mm). **Filtration:** Pressure filters or rotary vacuum filters, remove final fines. Filtrate clarity: <20 ppm suspended solids (specification for crystallization, particles seed premature precipitation). Pregnant liquor: 100-200 g/L Al₂O₃ (as sodium aluminate), 120-250 g/L Na₂O (excess caustic), clear amber solution, pH 13-14. Red mud: 30-60% solids slurry, composition 30-60% Fe₂O₃, 10-30% Al₂O₃ (unrecovered), 5-25% SiO₂, 5-15% TiO₂, remainder Na₂O, CaO, organics. Disposal: waste ponds, lagoons (major environmental issue - caustic, toxic metals, radioactive thorium/uranium traces). Production: 1-1.5 tonnes red mud per tonne alumina (100-150 Mt/year globally, stored in 1,000+ tailings dams worldwide).

**Step 79-100: Precipitation (Crystallization)**
Supersaturate pregnant liquor, precipitate aluminum hydroxide. Cool liquor from 140-150°C (digestion) to 55-80°C (precipitation, slow cool over 12-48 hours in heat exchangers, recover heat). Lower temperature shifts equilibrium: NaAlO₂ + 2H₂O → Al(OH)₃ ↓ + NaOH (reversal of dissolution, aluminum hydroxide crystallizes, caustic regenerated). **Seed precipitation:** Add seed crystals (fine Al(OH)₃ from previous batch, 10-40 g/L, 20-90 µm size) to initiate nucleation, control crystal size. Without seed: spontaneous nucleation → very fine crystals (difficult to filter, wash, calcine). With seed: crystals grow on seed surfaces (50-120 µm product, ideal size). **Precipitation tanks:** Agitated tanks (5-30 m³), 55-80°C, 24-72 hours residence (slow crystallization, coarse crystals). Gentle agitation (20-50 rpm, ribbon or anchor impellers, prevent attrition). Cool further if needed (to 40-60°C, increase supersaturation, yield 40-60% of dissolved alumina crystallizes, remainder stays in liquor - pregnant liquor → spent liquor). **Classification:** Hydrocyclones separate coarse product (>44 µm, exits underflow) from fines (<44 µm, recycle as seed). Coarse product to washing/filtration.

**Step 101-120: Washing and Filtration**
Wash precipitated Al(OH)₃ to remove entrained caustic (NaOH adheres to crystal surface, must remove - otherwise calcines to sodium aluminate impurity, consumes aluminum, lowers purity). **Countercurrent washing:** 3-6 stages, hot water (70-90°C) flows countercurrent to solids. Dilutes liquor from 150 g/L Na₂O (spent liquor) to <5 g/L (wash liquor). Water consumption: 1-3 m³/tonne Al(OH)₃. **Filtration:** Rotary vacuum filters (drum filter, 2-4m diameter, 3-8m long, cloth filter media), cake thickness 50-100mm, moisture 10-20%. Vacuum: 0.3-0.5 bar. Wash on filter: spray water, displaces liquor. Final cake: 12-20% moisture, 0.2-1% Na₂O (as residual caustic or sodalite contamination). **Drying (optional):** Fluid bed dryer or rotary dryer, reduce moisture to 1-3% (depends on calcination step tolerance). Dried Al(OH)₃: fluffy white powder, bulk density 0.5-0.9 g/cm³, particle size 50-120 µm (sand or ground-glass grade).

**Step 121-142: [Calcination](rotary-kiln) to Alumina**
Decompose Al(OH)₃ to Al₂O₃ by heating. Reaction: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O (endothermic, ΔH = +107 kJ/mol, occurs 200-400°C). **Calciner types:** (1) Rotary kiln: inclined rotating tube 3-5m diameter, 50-150m long, natural gas or oil burner at discharge end, temperature zones 300-1,200°C along length, residence time 1-4 hours, capacity 100-500 tonnes/day Al₂O₃. (2) Fluidized bed calciner: vertical vessel, hot gas (800-1,000°C) fluidizes Al(OH)₃ particles, rapid heat transfer, 5-10 seconds residence (flash calcination), capacity 200-1,000 tonnes/day. **Temperature stages:** 200-400°C: dehydrate, form transition aluminas (γ, η, δ, θ phases, metastable, high surface area 100-300 m²/g). 1,000-1,200°C: transform to α-Al₂O₃ (corundum, stable crystal structure, low surface area 1-10 m²/g, dense, hard). Metallurgical-grade alumina (smelter-grade): calcine at 1,000-1,200°C (α-Al₂O₃, "sandy alumina", particle size 50-150 µm, bulk density 0.9-1.1 g/cm³, free-flowing, low moisture <0.5%). Specialty aluminas: calcine at 400-900°C (γ, δ, θ phases, high surface area, used in catalysts, adsorbents, ceramics). Energy: 1.0-1.5 GJ/tonne Al₂O₃ (fuel for calcination, major cost component).

**Step 143-160: Product Specifications and Quality**
**Smelter-grade alumina (SGA):** 98.5-99.5% Al₂O₃, <0.04% SiO₂, <0.02% Fe₂O₃, <0.4% Na₂O, <0.02% LOI (loss on ignition, residual moisture + volatiles), <10 ppm heavy metals (V, P, Zn each). Particle size distribution (PSD): d₅₀ = 60-100 µm, narrow range (good flow, even dissolution in electrolysis bath). Angle of repose: 30-40° (measure flowability, important for alumina feeders in smelters). Attrition index: <10% (abrasion resistance, minimize dust formation during handling/transport). α-Al₂O₃ content: >90% (remainder transition aluminas γ, δ if calcination incomplete). **Chemical-grade (high-purity):** 99.7-99.99% Al₂O₃, <0.01% SiO₂, <0.01% Fe₂O₃, <0.005% Na₂O. Used for specialty ceramics (spark plugs, substrates, refractories). **Calcined aluminas (specialty):** γ-Al₂O₃ (surface area 200-300 m²/g, catalyst support, desiccant), δ/θ-Al₂O₃ (surface area 50-100 m²/g, catalyst, adsorbent). Tabular alumina: calcine at 1,900-2,000°C, dense polycrystalline α-Al₂O₃, low porosity, high thermal shock resistance (refractory bricks, kiln linings). **Fused alumina:** Electric arc furnace, melt alumina at 2,050°C (above melting point 2,072°C), cool rapidly (amorphous) or slowly (crystalline), crush. White fused alumina (WFA): 99.5% Al₂O₃, abrasive (grinding wheels, sandpaper, blasting media). Brown fused alumina (BFA): 95-97% Al₂O₃, contains TiO₂, tougher abrasive.

**Step 161-175: Process Efficiency and Caustic Recovery**
**Caustic loop:** Spent liquor from precipitation (60-120 g/L Na₂O, depleted in alumina) returned to digestion (makeup fresh NaOH to 150-250 g/L). Caustic recycling: >95% (5% losses to red mud, sodalite formation, evaporation). Makeup caustic: 10-30 kg NaOH/tonne Al₂O₃ (depends on bauxite silica content). **Energy integration:** Heat exchangers recover heat from hot pregnant liquor (140-150°C) to preheat incoming slurry, digester steam condensate preheats wash water. Evaporation: concentrate spent liquor if diluted (multi-effect evaporators, increase Na₂O concentration). **Water balance:** Process water intensive: 1-3 m³/tonne Al₂O₃ (washing, cooling, steam). Recycle 80-95% (closed-loop, water treatment). **Yield:** 1.9-2.0 tonnes bauxite (50-55% Al₂O₃) → 1 tonne Al₂O₃. Overall recovery: 92-96% of alumina in bauxite extracted (losses to red mud 4-8%, incomplete digestion, washing losses). Alumina from bauxite → aluminum metal: 1.9-2.0 tonnes Al₂O₃ + 15-17 MWh electricity → 1 tonne Al (Hall-Héroult electrolysis).

**Step 176-185: Red Mud Disposal and Environmental Issues**
Red mud: highly alkaline (pH 11-13, residual NaOH), fine particles (1-50 µm, difficult to dewater), toxic metals (As, Cr, V, Hg traces, vary by bauxite source), radioactive (U-238, Th-232 concentrate 2-5× vs bauxite, mostly thorium decay → radon Rn-222 gas). **Storage:** Tailings dams, clay-lined impoundments, 10-100 million tonnes capacity. Seepage risk: alkaline leachate contaminates groundwater, pH, sodium, aluminate. **Neutralization:** Add seawater, CO₂, gypsum, or acidsto pH 7-9 (reduce caustic, safer disposal). Energy/chemical costs significant. **Utilization attempts:** Construction (bricks, cement additive), iron recovery (mag separation → Fe₂O₃ for steel), soil amendment (neutralized mud, trace minerals). Utilization <5% of production (most stockpiled, 4+ billion tonnes accumulated globally). **Accidents:** Ajka, Hungary (2010, dam burst, 1 million m³ red mud flood, 10 deaths, 120 km² contaminated). Alunorte, Brazil (2018, overflow during heavy rain, community exposure). Regulations tightening: EU Industrial Emissions Directive, US EPA RCRA (hazardous waste classification debated), tailings dam safety standards.

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Economics**
Global alumina production: 140 Mt/year (2023). China: 75 Mt (54%), Australia: 20 Mt (14%), Brazil: 9 Mt, India: 7 Mt, Guinea + Jamaica: 5 Mt each, Russia: 3 Mt, USA: 1 Mt. Integrated producers: mine bauxite → refine alumina → smelt aluminum (vertical integration). Merchant market: sell alumina to independent smelters (20-30% of production traded). Price: $250-600/tonne (2010-2024 range, tracks aluminum price + energy costs). Recent: $300-400/tonne (long-term contracts), $350-500/tonne (spot). Breakeven cost: $200-350/tonne (depends on bauxite grade SM >10 low-cost $200-250, SM 5-7 high-silica $300-350). Cost breakdown: bauxite 25%, caustic/chemicals 25%, energy (natural gas, electricity) 30%, labor/overhead 10%, capex amortization 10%. Energy: 10-14 GJ/tonne Al₂O₃ (6-9 GJ thermal for calcination, 1-2 GJ steam for digestion/evaporation, 0.3-0.5 GJ electricity for grinding/pumping). Carbon footprint: 1.5-2.5 tonnes CO₂/tonne Al₂O₃ (natural gas combustion, electricity). Alumina-to-aluminum: 1.9-2.0 tonnes alumina + 15-17 MWh → 1 tonne Al + CO₂ anode consumption.

Price: $0.80/kg ($800/tonne) represents metallurgical-grade alumina for aluminum smelting. Actual market prices $300-500/tonne, but in supply chain allocation model the $0.80 represents normalized input cost for aluminum production and other industrial uses (ceramics, abrasives, refractories, catalysts). Specialty aluminas (high-purity, tabular, fused): $1-10/kg depending on grade and application. Per chip: minimal direct use (some ceramic packages use alumina substrate, few mg per chip → negligible cost contribution). Aluminum metal derived from alumina used in chip packaging (lids, heat spreaders), equipment frames, construction.
