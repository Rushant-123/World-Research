# How to Make an M3 Chip

The M3 chip is Apple's custom-designed processor manufactured by TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) using advanced 3-nanometer process technology. It combines CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine on a single piece of silicon.

## What is it?

A system-on-a-chip (SoC) containing billions of transistors packed into a tiny area. It handles all computing tasks for Mac computers including processing, graphics, machine learning, and power management. Designed by Apple in California, manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan.

## Steps to Make:

1. Start with a pure [Silicon Wafer](silicon-wafer) manufactured from sand
2. Transport the wafer to a [Cleanroom Facility](cleanroom-facility) with air filtration
3. Use [Electricity](electricity) to power all manufacturing equipment throughout the process
4. Clean the wafer surface with [Ultra-Pure Water](ultra-pure-water)
5. Apply photoresist coating to the wafer surface
6. Use a [Photolithography Machine](photolithography-machine) to project the circuit pattern onto the wafer using extreme ultraviolet light
7. The light exposes specific areas of the photoresist
8. Wash away the exposed photoresist with developer chemicals
9. Use [Chemical Etchants](chemical-etchants) to remove silicon from exposed areas
10. Strip away remaining photoresist
11. Implant [Doping Materials](doping-materials) (boron, phosphorus) into specific regions to create transistors
12. Grow thin insulating oxide layers
13. Repeat steps 5-12 hundreds of times to build up multiple layers
14. Deposit [Metal Layers](metal-layers) (copper) to create interconnections between transistors
15. Ask an adult to help with chemical handling as many materials are hazardous
16. Polish the surface using chemical-mechanical planarization
17. Continue layering until all circuits are complete
18. Cut the wafer into individual chips using a diamond saw
19. Mount each chip onto [Packaging Materials](chip-packaging) substrate
20. Connect the chip to the package using wire bonding or flip-chip connections
21. Seal the package to protect the chip
22. Use [Testing Equipment](testing-equipment) to verify each chip functions correctly
23. [Fab Workers](semiconductor-labor) monitor the entire process and handle wafer transport
24. Sort chips by performance characteristics (some become higher-end M3 Pro/Max variants)
25. Ship working chips to Apple for use in Mac computers

The entire process takes several weeks and happens in an ultra-clean environment where even a single dust particle can ruin a chip. This is why semiconductors are so expensive to manufacture.
