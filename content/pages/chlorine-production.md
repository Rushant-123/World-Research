1. Brine preparation from salt
2. Salt dissolved in water to 25-28% concentration
3. Brine purification removes calcium and magnesium
4. Addition of sodium carbonate and caustic
5. Settling tank removes precipitates
6. Filtered brine to electrolysis cells
7. Membrane cell technology (modern plants)
8. Anode: titanium coated with ruthenium oxide
9. Cathode: nickel or stainless steel
10. Ion exchange membrane separates chambers
11. Anolyte: brine (NaCl solution)
12. Catholyte: caustic soda (NaOH solution)
13. Applied voltage: 3-4 volts per cell
14. Cell temperature: 85-95°C
15. Anode reaction: 2Cl⁻ → Cl2 + 2e⁻
16. Cathode reaction: 2H2O + 2e⁻ → H2 + 2OH⁻
17. Overall: 2NaCl + 2H2O → Cl2 + H2 + 2NaOH
18. Chlorine gas exits from anode chamber
19. Hydrogen gas exits from cathode chamber
20. Caustic soda solution concentrated
21. Chlorine gas cooled to condense water
22. Drying chlorine with concentrated sulfuric acid
23. Or using titanium heat exchangers
24. Dry chlorine compressed to 2-8 bar
25. Liquefaction at -34°C at 1 atm
26. Or pressure liquefaction at 6-8 bar, 20°C
27. Liquid chlorine storage in steel vessels
28. Hydrogen used as fuel or chemical feedstock
29. Caustic soda evaporated to 50% concentration
30. Current efficiency: 95-97%
31. Energy consumption: 2,500-3,000 kWh per ton Cl2
32. Membrane life: 3-5 years
33. Anode coating replacement every 5-10 years
34. Safety: chlorine leak detection systems
35. Scrubbers with caustic to neutralize leaks
36. Personnel PPE: full face respirators
37. Emergency response plan for chlorine release
38. Plant capacity: 100-1,000 tons Cl2 per day
