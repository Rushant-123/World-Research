46. Place [Speakers](speakers) into acoustic chambers molded into chassis
47. Connect speaker cables to logic board audio output
48. Install [Microphone](microphone) modules into designated slots
49. Connect microphone cables to logic board
50. Mount [USB-C Ports](usb-c-ports) into port cutouts

**Total Assembly Time:**
- Per unit: 5-8 minutes on production line
- Production line workers: 20-30 stations per line
- Daily output per line: 1,000-2,000 units
- Entire process from component arrival to packaged product: 2-4 hours

The Mac assembly process is highly automated with precision robotics handling some steps, but many delicate operations (cable routing, connector insertion, testing) still require skilled human workers. Quality control is rigorous - defect rates are kept below 1%.
