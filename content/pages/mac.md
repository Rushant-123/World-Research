# How to Make a Mac Computer

A Mac is a personal computer designed and assembled by Apple. It runs macOS and is built from components sourced from suppliers around the world, primarily manufactured in China.

## What is it?

A laptop or desktop computer featuring Apple's custom silicon chip (M-series), aluminum unibody construction, high-resolution display, and macOS operating system. Known for integration between hardware and software, energy efficiency, and build quality.

## Steps to Make:

1. Source an [M3 Chip](m3-chip) from TSMC manufacturing facilities
2. Obtain a custom [Logic Board](logic-board) designed by Apple with power management and connectivity circuits
3. Get a high-resolution Retina [Display Panel](display-panel) from Samsung or LG
4. Acquire [Display Cables](display-cable) to connect the panel to the logic board
5. Machine an [Aluminum Chassis](aluminum-chassis) from a single block of aluminum using CNC mills
6. Source a [Lithium Battery](lithium-battery) pack with appropriate capacity
7. Get internal [Power Cables](power-cables) for connecting components
8. Obtain [Speakers](speakers) for audio output
9. Install a [Camera Module](camera-module) for video calls
10. Get [USB-C Ports](usb-c-ports) for data and charging
11. Source [Screws & Fasteners](metal-fasteners) to hold everything together
12. Obtain [Thermal Paste](thermal-paste) for heat transfer from chip to chassis
13. Get a [Keyboard Assembly](keyboard-assembly) with backlit keys
14. Source a [Trackpad](trackpad) with Force Touch technology
15. Obtain a [Wi-Fi Card](wifi-card) for wireless connectivity
16. Get an [SSD Storage](ssd-storage) drive for data storage
17. Source a [Cooling Fan](cooling-fan) or heat pipe system
18. In a clean assembly facility in China, trained workers ([Assembly Labor](electronics-assembly)) begin assembly
19. Mount the M3 chip onto the logic board
20. Apply thermal paste to the chip surface
21. Connect the display cable to the logic board
22. Install the SSD storage module
23. Mount the Wi-Fi card
24. Install the battery and connect power cables
25. Mount speakers and camera module
26. Install USB-C ports
27. Attach the keyboard assembly
28. Install the trackpad
29. Mount the logic board assembly into the aluminum chassis using screws
30. Install the display panel into the lid of the chassis
31. Connect the cooling fan or attach heat pipes to the chassis
32. Ask an adult to help seal the chassis (requires special adhesives and tools)
33. Flash the [macOS Software](macos) onto the SSD
34. Run automated testing to verify all components work
35. Place the finished Mac into [Packaging Materials](packaging) with accessories
36. Ship to distribution centers and retail stores

The result is a fully assembled Mac computer ready for use, with all hardware components integrated and software pre-installed.
