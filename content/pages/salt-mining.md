Essential mineral - sodium chloride. Uses: chemical feedstock (chlor-alkali caustic soda + chlorine, 40%), deicing roads (25%), food processing/preservation (6%), agriculture feed (5%), water treatment (4%), industrial processes (10%), table salt (1%), other 9%. Global production: 300 million tonnes/year (2023). Sources: rock salt mining (45%), solution mining/brine (35%), solar salt evaporation (15%), vacuum salt (5%).

**Step 1-15: Geology of Salt Deposits**
Halite (NaCl mineral) forms from evaporation of ancient seas. **Formation:** Restricted marine basin (shallow sea, hot arid climate, inflow seawater < evaporation rate), salinity increases, minerals precipitate in sequence as solubility limits exceeded: (1) CaCO₃ limestone (first, least soluble), (2) CaSO₄·2H₂O gypsum, (3) NaCl halite (when seawater concentrated 10× original), (4) MgSO₄ epsomite, (5) KCl sylvite + MgCl₂ bischofite (last, most soluble, form only if extreme 50-100× concentration). Cycles repeat (transgression-regression), layered evaporite sequences (halite beds 10-300m thick interbedded with shale, anhydrite, dolomite). Age: Permian 280-250 Mya (USA Kansas, Michigan, Texas Permian Basin, Germany Zechstein), Silurian 430 Mya (Michigan, Ohio, Appalachian basins, Williston Basin), Devonian (Canada Prairie Evaporite), Jurassic (Gulf of Mexico, North Sea), Triassic (Europe). **Salt domes:** Diapirs (buoyant salt rises through denser overlying sediments, 200-500 density of sediments 2.2-2.5 g/cm³ vs halite 2.16 g/cm³, differential drives upward flow over millions years). Form cylindrical or mushroom-shaped intrusions (0.5-5 km diameter, rise 5-15 km from source bed, pierce overlying strata). Trap petroleum (salt impermeaable cap rock, structural trap, Gulf of Mexico 1,000+ salt domes, many oil/gas fields). **Deposits:** Worldwide, 3,500+ Gt reserves (virtually unlimited, 100,000+ years at current consumption). Major: USA (250 Mt/year, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, New York, Texas), China (70 Mt), Germany (15 Mt Zechstein), Canada (12 Mt Saskatchewan), India (25 Mt), UK (6 Mt Cheshire).

**Step 16-38: [Room-and-Pillar Underground Mining](room-pillar-mining)**
45% of salt production. Mine solid halite from bedded deposits 200-600m depth. **Access:** Vertical shafts (6-8m diameter, concrete-lined steel, twin shafts for ventilation + egress, 1-3 years sinking, $50-200M cost). Or decline ramps (spiral 8-12% grade, truck haulage). Depth: 200-600m typical (shallower <200m surface subsidence risk, deeper >1,000m geothermal heat + pressure challenges, 30°C/km gradient, stress fracturing). **Room-and-pillar layout:** Drive horizontal entries 6-10m wide × 4-6m high into salt seam (seam thickness 2-15m, mine thickest portions). Rooms: 15-30m wide, 100-200m long. Pillars: 15-30m × 15-30m, support overburden weight (extraction ratio 50-70%, leave 30-50% salt as pillars). **Mining equipment:** Continuous miners (similar to coal mining, rotating cutting head with tungsten carbide picks, 200-500 kW, cut 1-3 tonnes/min, load onto shuttle cars or continuous haulage belt). Boring machines (tunnel boring heads for entries). Drill-blast (less common in salt, soft rock Mohs 2.5, cuttable, but blast if hard layers or anhydrite). Haul: battery-electric vehicles (diesel prohibited in confined spaces, emissions, LHD load-haul-dump or shuttle cars, 10-20 tonne capacity). Crush underground: jaw crusher or impactor (reduce to -200mm), conveyor belt to shaft, hoist to surface (skip capacity 10-50 tonnes, cycle 2-5 min). **Ventilation:** Force fresh air (main fan 1-5 MW, 50-300 m³/s), exhaust via return shaft (salt dust <10 mg/m³ exposure limit, pressurized cabs on equipment, respirators). Humidity control: salt hygroscopic (absorbs moisture if relative humidity >75%, caking, handling issues), dehumidify intake air if necessary. **Stability:** Salt behaves plastically (creep closure 1-5 cm/year, rooms slowly narrow, pillars widen, equilibrates over 10-50 years). Design for 50-100 year stability (eventual closure, pillars yield but prevent catastrophic collapse).

**Step 39-60: [Solution Mining](brine-extraction) (Brine Production)**
35% of salt production. Dissolve underground salt, pump saturated brine to surface. **Well drilling:** Drill to salt bed (300-1,500m depth, larger diameter 200-400mm), case with steel pipe, cement annulus. Inject fresh water down tubing (concentric pipe, water flows inner string, brine returns outer annulus or vice versa). **Cavern development:** Water dissolves salt: NaCl(s) + H₂O → Na⁺ + Cl⁻ (saturated brine 315-320 g NaCl/L at 20°C, 26% concentration, density 1.20 g/cm³). Dissolution rate: 0.5-3 tonnes NaCl per m³ water injected (depends on temperature, flow, surface area). Cavern growth: dissolves preferentially at roof + walls (controlled by blanket - immiscible fluid butane or diesel floats on brine, protects roof if needed, unprotected dissolution creates tall chimney cavern 100-300m tall, 30-80m diameter). Cycle: inject 50-500 m³/hour water, return saturated brine continuously. Development: 1-5 years to create 100,000-1,000,000 m³ cavern volume. **Cavern uses:** Salt production (brine to chlor-alkali plants, vacuum salt evaporators). Strategic petroleum reserve (USA SPR, 700 million barrels oil stored in solution-mined caverns, inject crude oil, displace brine, oil stable storage 30+ years, withdrawal in energy crisis). Natural gas storage (compressed gas 5-20 MPa, caverns seasonal swing storage, inject summer, withdraw winter, 40-80 cycles over 30 years). **Multiple caverns:** Field of 5-50 caverns per salt dome (spacing 100-300m center-to-center, minimum 2× cavern diameter to prevent breakthrough, stability models ensure pillars between caverns adequate). Production: 100,000-3,000,000 tonnes NaCl/year per cavern field.

**Step 61-82: [Solar Salt Evaporation](salt-ponds)**
15% of production. Evaporate seawater in shallow ponds, harvest salt crust. Locations: tropical/subtropical coasts (high solar radiation 5-7 kWh/m²/day, low rainfall <500 mm/year, San Francisco Bay California, Great Salt Lake Utah, Mediterranean, Middle East, Australia Shark Bay, Mexico, India Gujarat, Caribbean). **Seawater composition:** 3.5% salinity (35 g/L dissolved solids, 27 g/L NaCl, 3.8 g/L MgCl₂, 1.7 g/L MgSO₄, 1.3 g/L CaSO₄, 0.9 g/L K₂SO₄, traces Br⁻, I⁻, Sr²⁺). Must concentrate 10× to precipitate NaCl. **Pond series (multi-stage concentration):** (1) Concentrator ponds (1st stage, 5-30 cm deep, 10-100 hectares each, seawater enters, solar evaporation 5-15 mm/day, residence 6-12 months, concentrate 2.5-3.5× to 8-12% salinity). Gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) precipitates first (less soluble than NaCl, 2-3 g/L solubility), settles as bottom sludge (discard or remove periodically). (2) Intermediate ponds (2nd-3rd stages, evaporate 12-24 months, 15-25% salinity). (3) Crystallizer ponds (final, 25-27% salinity, saturated NaCl, salt crystallizes as bottom crust 10-30 cm thick over 3-12 months). Harvest: when crust sufficient thickness (10-30 cm, 100-300 kg/m² yield), drain residual brine (bitterns, high Mg/K, byproduct for magnesium chloride, potash, bromine extraction or discard). **Harvesting:** Mechanized (front-end loaders, salt harvesters scrape/pickup, windrow, load trucks, 50-200 tonnes/hour) or manual (artisanal, shovel into baskets, 0.1-1 tonne/day per worker, developing countries Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, India). Wash: spray seawater or saturated brine (remove clay, gypsum, organic debris). Stockpile: conical piles 5-20m tall, 10,000-100,000 tonnes, open-air storage (salt stable, rain washes surface but interior dry). **Quality:** 95-99% NaCl (impurities: CaSO₄ 0.5-3%, MgCl₂ 0.3-1.5%, insolubles clay/sand 0.2-1%), gray or off-white color (mineral content), cubic crystal habit (1-10mm cubes). Refine if higher purity required: redissolve, filter, recrystallize.

**Step 83-102: Vacuum Salt Production (Highest Purity)**
5% of production. Evaporate purified brine in vacuum evaporators, produce ultra-pure salt. **Brine purification:** Solution-mined brine (natural or dissolve rock salt in saturator) contains Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, sulfate impurities (0.01-0.5% depending on source). Precipitate Ca²⁺: add soda ash Na₂CO₃, forms CaCO₃ ↓, filter. Precipitate Mg²⁺: add caustic NaOH, forms Mg(OH)₂ ↓, filter. Remove sulfate: add BaCl₂, forms BaSO₄ ↓, filter. Purified brine: 310-320 g/L NaCl, <0.01% Ca, <0.005% Mg, <0.02% SO₄, <0.005% insolubles. **Evaporation:** Multi-effect vacuum evaporators (3-7 effects, falling-film or forced circulation, stainless steel or titanium, each effect operates lower pressure/temperature than previous). First effect: steam heat (110-130°C, 1.5-2.5 bar), boil brine, evaporate water, NaCl concentration increases. Vapor from first effect heats second effect (at lower pressure 0.5-1 bar, boiling point 90-110°C). Continue 3-7 effects (final effect under vacuum 0.1-0.3 bar, 50-70°C). Energy efficiency: 3-7 effects reuse latent heat, overall 0.2-0.4 tonnes steam per tonne water evaporated (vs 1.0 single-effect). **Crystallization:** NaCl supersaturates, crystals nucleate and grow (fine crystals 100-500 µm, controlled by supersaturation rate, seed recycling, residence time 2-6 hours). Slurry (salt + mother liquor 20-30% solids) to centrifuge. **Centrifuge:** Batch or continuous centrifuge (1,000-3,000 rpm), liquid spins off, salt cake retains 1-3% moisture. Dry: fluidized bed or rotary dryer (100-200°C hot air, <0.5% moisture). **Product:** Vacuum salt, 99.6-99.9% NaCl (food-grade, pharmaceutical, chemical reagent). Crystal size: granulated (0.2-1mm, table salt, food processing), flake (1-4mm, water softening, chlor-alkali), coarse (2-5mm, industrial). Free-flowing: add anti-caking agents (sodium ferrocyanide 10 ppm, tricalcium phosphate 0.5%, magnesium carbonate 0.5%, prevents moisture absorption). Iodized salt: add potassium iodide or iodate 20-100 mg I/kg (prevent iodine deficiency goiter, mandatory fortification 120+ countries).

**Step 103-120: Rock Salt Processing - Crushing and Screening**
Underground-mined rock salt (run-of-mine ROM): 95-99% NaCl, 1-5% insolubles (clay, anhydrite CaSO₄, shale). Process for industrial/deicing applications (95-98% purity adequate, no recrystallization needed). **Crushing:** Primary jaw crusher (ROM 500-1,000mm → 150mm), secondary cone or impact crusher (150mm → 10-50mm). Tertiary if needed (fine grades <5mm). Screens: vibrating screens separate size fractions (coarse 50-150mm, medium 10-50mm, fine 1-10mm, screenings <1mm). **Sizing products:** Rock salt lump (50-150mm, ice control road spreading, water softener regeneration), medium (10-50mm, industrial deicing, chemical feedstock), fine/granular (1-10mm, agricultural feed, industrial chemical if meets purity), screenings (<1mm, deicing brine production or discard/landfill). **Deicing salt treatment:** Anti-caking agents (sodium ferrocyanide yellow prussiate 10-100 ppm, YPS, prevents clumping in storage), corrosion inhibitors (optional for treated deicing salt, sodium ferrocyanide also inhibits steel rust), color additives (blue/green dye 1-10 ppm, visibility on roads). **Storage:** Covered domes or open stockpiles (salt stable outdoors, rain partially dissolves surface but self-healing, leachate contains NaCl, collect in sumps, treat or discharge to sewers if permitted). Load-out: front-end loaders, conveyors to railcars (100-tonne cars), trucks (20-40 tonne loads), barges (1,500-3,000 tonnes).

**Step 121-138: Deicing Salt Application (Largest Use 25%)**
Road/highway winter maintenance: 20-22 million tonnes/year USA, 3-5 Mt Canada, 5 Mt Europe, 1 Mt Japan. **Mechanism:** NaCl dissolves in water film on ice/snow, lowers freezing point (colligative property, 10% NaCl solution freezes at -6°C, 20% eutectic freezes at -21°C, vs pure water 0°C). Brine layer between ice and pavement weakens bond, mechanical removal by plows easier. Effective temperature: 0°C to -9°C (NaCl effectiveness declines below -10°C, requires calcium chloride CaCl₂ or magnesium chloride MgCl₂ for lower temps down to -25°C). **Application:** Spread dry salt 50-200 g/m² lane (pre-storm anti-icing 30-80 g/m², post-storm deicing 100-250 g/m², multiple applications per storm). Trucks: hopper 5-15 m³ capacity, spinner or auger spreader, GPS-controlled rate, 10-30 km/h spreading speed. Or pre-wet: mix dry salt with brine (23% NaCl solution, 20-30% liquid by weight), improves adhesion, reduces scatter/bounce, 30-40% salt savings. **Environmental concerns:** Chloride pollution (runoff to streams/groundwater, toxic to aquatic life >250 mg/L Cl⁻ chronic, >860 mg/L acute, many streams near highways 500-5,000 mg/L winter peaks, summertime baseflow elevated 100-1,000 mg/L from aquifer storage). Soil/vegetation damage (sodium displaces Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ in soil, causes crusting, roadside trees dieback). Vehicle corrosion (salt accelerates steel rust, undercarriage damage, $3-5 billion/year USA). Alternatives: calcium chloride CaCl₂ (lower temp -25°C, more expensive $200-400/tonne vs NaCl $50-100/tonne), magnesium chloride MgCl₂, beet juice/cheese brine organics (pilot projects), sand/grit (traction only, no melting, must sweep cleanup spring, particulates PM10 air quality issues).

**Step 139-155: Chemical Feedstock - Chlor-Alkali Production**
40% of global salt (120 Mt/year) consumed as chlor-alkali feedstock. Produce caustic soda (NaOH, 80 Mt/year) + chlorine (Cl₂, 70 Mt/year) by electrolysis of salt brine. Process: see caustic-soda.md page for details. Membrane cell: 2NaCl + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂ + Cl₂ (electricity 2,000-2,500 kWh/tonne NaOH, consumes 1.50 tonnes NaCl per tonne NaOH + 0.886 tonnes Cl₂ co-product). Salt specifications: >99.5% NaCl, <0.3% Ca²⁺ + Mg²⁺ (membrane poisoning), <0.005% Fe, <0.02% SO₄²⁻. Typically vacuum salt (99.8% NaCl, highest purity) or solution-mined brine purified on-site. Delivered: dry salt in railcars/trucks (dissolve in saturators), or direct brine pipeline (solution mining at plant site or pipeline from nearby field, most economical if <50 km, 5-10 MPa pressure, 10-100 m³/hour flow).

**Step 156-170: Food and Agriculture Applications**
**Food processing (6%, 18 Mt/year):** Preservation (curing meat, pickling vegetables, cheese-making, 10-20% salt content inhibits bacterial growth, osmotic stress). Flavor: table salt (1-3 g/person/day typical intake, WHO recommends <5 g/day, high intake linked hypertension, cardiovascular disease, most intake from processed foods not discretionary). Baking (controls yeast fermentation, gluten development, 1-2% flour weight). Texture: processed meats (binders, water retention, 2-4% sausage formulations). Food-grade specs: 99.0-99.8% NaCl (vacuum salt 99.7% typical), <50 ppm Ca, <50 ppm Mg, <10 ppm Fe, <20 ppm Cu, <5 ppm heavy metals (Pb, As, Hg each <1 ppm), <2 ppm iodine if non-iodized, <0.005% insolubles. Codex Alimentarius, FDA, EU standards (microbiological purity, no cyanide, low bromate/chlorate if electrolytic, certified kosher/halal). Iodization: 15-50 ppm iodine (KI or KIO₃, stable during storage). **Animal feed (5%, 15 Mt/year):** Salt blocks (pressed salt 2-25 kg blocks, cattle/sheep/horses lick for sodium, essential nutrient 0.1-0.2% diet, deficiency reduces appetite/growth). Loose salt (mix in feed ration 0.3-0.5%, poultry/swine). Trace mineralized salt (add Co, Cu, I, Zn, Se, vitamin A, 99% NaCl base + micronutrient premix). Specifications: 95-99.5% NaCl (feed-grade, tolerates higher impurities than food, <4% insolubles, <0.15% fluorine cumulative toxicity issue in cattle).

**Step 171-180: Industrial Applications**
**Water treatment (4%, 12 Mt/year):** Ion exchange regeneration (water softeners, remove Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ hardness, strong acid cation resin, regenerate with 5-12% NaCl brine, 0.15-0.3 kg NaCl per liter resin per cycle). Chlor-alkali on-site hypochlorite (small plants, brine electrolysis → sodium hypochlorite NaOCl, 0.8-1.5% active chlorine, swimming pools, drinking water disinfection). Membrane brine (brackish desalination reverse osmosis, dispose concentrate, chloride content 35,000-70,000 ppm). **Pulp/paper (2%, 6 Mt/year):** Chlorine dioxide generation (ClO₂, bleaching agent, from NaClO₂ sodium chlorite + Cl₂ or acid, safer than Cl₂ gas, less dioxin formation). Kraft recovery (chlor-alkali caustic production integrated with pulp mills). **Textile/dyeing (2%, 6 Mt/year):** Salt-dyeing (cotton reactive dyes, NaCl 30-80 g/L in dyebath, promotes dye exhaustion onto fiber, 30-60% of dye bath mass). Desizing (starch removal, washing). **Metallurgy (1%, 3 Mt/year):** Aluminum recycling (remove magnesium from scrap, flux with NaCl/KCl, Mg oxidizes preferentially). Sodium production (Downs cell electrolysis, molten NaCl 600°C, produces metallic sodium, chlorine). Titanium (Kroll process, TiCl₄ intermediate, uses Cl₂ from chlor-alkali). **Other:** Soap manufacturing (salting out, separate soap from glycerin, saturate with NaCl, soap precipitates). Drilling fluids (oil/gas wells, weighting agent, formation brine compatibility). Fire extinguishers (dry powder, sodium bicarbonate base). Glazes/ceramics (flux, lower melting point). Photography (fixer, sodium thiosulfate production).

**Step 181-195: Market, Pricing, and Economics**
Global salt: 300 Mt/year production (2023, all sources combined). China 70 Mt (23%), USA 42 Mt (14%), India 30 Mt (10%), Germany 14 Mt (5%), Canada 12 Mt (4%), Australia 12 Mt (4%), Mexico 10 Mt (3%), Netherlands 7 Mt (2%), Chile 7 Mt (2%), other 96 Mt (33%). **By source:** Rock salt (underground) 135 Mt (45%), solution-mined brine 105 Mt (35%, includes chlor-alkali captive), solar salt 45 Mt (15%), vacuum salt 15 Mt (5%). **Pricing:** Bulk rock salt $30-80/tonne (deicing, ex-mine Midwest USA $40-60/tonne), vacuum salt $100-300/tonne (food-grade, industrial high-purity), solar salt $25-60/tonne (chemical feedstock, export FOB $30-50/tonne Australia/Mexico). Wide variation by region (landlocked $50-100/tonne, coastal with solar salt $20-40/tonne), quality (deicing $30-70, food $80-250, pharma/reagent $500-5,000/tonne), packaging (bulk $40-80, bags $150-400/tonne). **Cost structure:** Underground mining $15-40/tonne (drilling, blasting, hoisting, power, labor). Solution mining $8-25/tonne (water, pumps, cavern development amortized, power). Solar salt $10-30/tonne (land, pond construction, maintenance, harvesting labor). Vacuum salt $40-120/tonne (brine, evaporation energy 0.4 GJ/tonne, equipment, higher purity). Transport dominates delivered cost (rail $15-40/tonne for 500-2,000 km, truck $5-25/tonne for 50-300 km, bulk carriers $10-30/tonne seaborne). **Trade:** 40 Mt/year seaborne (13% of production), exports Chile/Mexico/Australia (solar salt low-cost), imports USA/Canada (supplement domestic, coastal demand), Japan (100% imported, no deposits), China (net exporter solar salt, importer high-purity), Europe balanced (Germany/Netherlands rock salt vs Mediterranean solar salt). **Environmental:** Brine disposal (solution mining returns undersaturated brine to aquifer if reinjected, or discharge to surface, chloride permits 250-500 mg/L effluent limits, challenge in low-flow streams). Subsidence (cavern collapse rare if proper design, pressure monitoring, but catastrophic if occurs, sinkhole formation, Hutchinson Kansas 1974, Detroit 1971). Solar salt lands (coastal habitat loss, 10,000-100,000 hectares per major facility, some restored as wetlands post-closure, flamingo habitat Mediterranean/Australia). Climate: negligible GHG (0.02-0.1 tonnes CO₂e per tonne salt, diesel + electricity minimal, product inert).

Price: $0.05/kg ($50/tonne) represents mid-range bulk rock salt for deicing or industrial chemical feedstock. Actual range $20-5,000/tonne depending on purity and application (deicing $30-80, solar chemical $25-60, vacuum food-grade $100-300, pharmaceutical $500-5,000). Used in: chlor-alkali NaOH/Cl₂ production (largest, 40%), deicing roads (25%), chemical processes (soda ash, sodium metals, chlorine chemicals), food preservation/flavor, agriculture animal feed, water softening. Per tonne caustic soda: 1.5 tonnes salt consumed → $75-120 raw material cost (bulk rate). Per km road winter: 5-20 tonnes salt/season → $150-1,600 deicing cost depending on severity/frequency.
