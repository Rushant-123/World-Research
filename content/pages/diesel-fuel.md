**Top Market Leaders:**

Middle distillate petroleum product - second most consumed transportation fuel after gasoline. Global production: 1.4 billion tonnes/year (28 million barrels/day, 2023). Diesel fuel: hydrocarbon mixture C10-C22 alkanes (paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics), boiling range 180-360°C. Primary use: compression-ignition engines (trucks, buses, construction equipment, trains, ships, backup generators). Properties: higher energy density than gasoline (36.9 MJ/L vs 32.4 MJ/L), better fuel economy, higher cetane number (ignition quality). Ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD): <15 ppm sulfur (US/EU standard since 2006-2009, reduces emissions, enables modern pollution controls).

**Step 1-20: [Crude Oil](crude-oil) Selection and Properties**
Crude oil: complex mixture of hydrocarbons from ancient organic matter (plankton, algae) buried 2-4 km deep, 60-150°C geothermal heat over 10-100 million years (catagenesis, thermal cracking of kerogen). Composition varies by source: light sweet crude (API gravity >31°, sulfur <0.5%, Arabian Light, West Texas Intermediate, Brent) yields more gasoline/diesel, easier to refine. Heavy sour crude (API <22°, sulfur >1.5%, Venezuelan, Canadian oil sands, Middle East heavy) yields more residual fuel, requires more processing. API gravity: (141.5/specific gravity at 60°F) - 131.5 (higher number = lighter, more valuable). Sulfur content: sweet <0.5%, sour 1-3%, ultra-sour >3% (sulfur forms H₂S, SO₂ pollutants, corrodes equipment, poisons catalysts). Diesel cut: typically 15-25% of crude barrel by volume (varies: light crude 20-30%, heavy crude 10-15%). Refineries blend crudes (2-10 different sources) to optimize yields, costs. **Crude receiving:** Tankers (VLCC 2 million barrel capacity) or pipelines deliver to refinery tank farm (storage tanks 50,000-500,000 barrels each, floating roof to minimize evaporation, weeks of inventory). Crude desalting: mix with water (3-10%), apply high voltage (15,000-35,000V AC), separate brine (removes salts NaCl, MgCl₂, CaCl₂ 10-1,000 ppm → <1 ppm, prevents corrosion, scale in heaters/distillation). Heat crude in fired heater (furnace, 350-400°C, fuel gas/residual oil combustion, 10-30 MW thermal, tube-still heater).

**Step 21-45: Atmospheric Distillation - Primary Separation**
[Crude distillation tower](crude-distillation-tower): vertical column 30-60m tall, 5-15m diameter, 30-50 trays (sieve, valve, or bubble-cap type). Heated crude (360-400°C, below thermal cracking threshold ~420°C) enters flash zone at bottom. Vapor rises, cools on trays, heavier components condense at different heights (fractional distillation). **Fractions by boiling point:** (1) Light ends/gas (C1-C4, <30°C): methane, ethane, propane, butane. Exit overhead, sent to gas processing. (2) Light naphtha (C5-C9, 30-90°C): gasoline blending stock or petrochemical feedstock. (3) Heavy naphtha (C9-C12, 90-180°C): gasoline or reformer feedstock. (4) Kerosene/jet fuel (C11-C13, 150-250°C): jet fuel or heating oil. (5) **Diesel/gas oil (C14-C20, 180-360°C)**: middle distillate, exits side draw at tray 15-25 (counting from bottom). Flow rate: 15,000-60,000 barrels/day (600,000-2.5M liters/day) in large refinery. Temperature: 250-320°C at draw tray. (6) Atmospheric gas oil (AGO, 350-400°C): heavy diesel cut, often reprocessed. (7) Atmospheric residue (>400°C, 30-50% of crude): bottoms product, sent to vacuum distillation or coker. **Reflux system:** Pump liquid from trays back down column (internal reflux increases separation efficiency, reflux ratio 0.3-1.5:1). Side strippers: small auxiliary columns on side draws (steam reboiler removes light ends trapped in diesel cut, improve flash point, reduce volatility). **Diesel cut quality:** Straight-run diesel from atmospheric tower: 0.2-1.5% sulfur (sweet crude 0.05-0.5%, sour crude 1-3%), cetane number 40-50 (natural paraffins high cetane 55-60, aromatics low cetane 20-40, requires blending/treatment), density 820-860 kg/m³.

**Step 46-70: Hydrotreating - Sulfur Removal and Upgrading**
Straight-run diesel contains sulfur (organic sulfur compounds: mercaptans R-SH, sulfides R-S-R, thiophenes, benzothiophenes), nitrogen (pyridines, quinolines, carbazoles), oxygen (phenols, acids), aromatics (benzene rings, 20-40% by mass). Must remove sulfur to meet ULSD spec <15 ppm (EPA/EU Tier 2 regulation 2006-2009, previous limit 500 ppm, earlier 5,000 ppm). **[Hydrotreater](hydrotreater) unit:** Fixed-bed catalytic reactor, 3-15m tall, 1.5-4m diameter, 10-100 tonnes catalyst. Diesel feed + [hydrogen gas](hydrogen-gas) (H₂, 300-600 Nm³/m³ diesel, 95-99% purity, 3-10 MPa pressure, 50-80 bar) heated to 320-380°C, pass through catalyst beds. [Catalyst](hydroprocessing-catalyst): cobalt-molybdenum on alumina support (CoO-MoO₃/Al₂O₃, 2-4% Co, 10-15% Mo, or nickel-molybdenum NiO-MoO₃ for high nitrogen feeds). Surface area: 150-300 m²/g. Particle: extrudates 1.5-3mm diameter, 3-10mm length (trilobe or quadrilobe shape, better packing, lower pressure drop than cylinders). **Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions:** (1) Mercaptans: R-SH + H₂ → RH + H₂S. (2) Sulfides: R-S-R' + 2H₂ → RH + R'H + H₂S. (3) Thiophenes (most difficult): C₄H₄S + 4H₂ → C₄H₁₀ + H₂S (ring saturation to tetrahydrothiophene, then C-S bond cleavage). (4) Benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene: require 10-30 bar H₂, 350-380°C (sterically hindered, 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene hardest to remove). **Hydrodenitrogenation (HDN):** Nitrogen compounds (50-500 ppm in feed) convert: quinoline C₉H₇N + 4H₂ → C₉H₁₃N (saturation) → propylcyclohexane + NH₃ (C-N cleavage, ammonia). **Aromatic saturation:** Aromatics partially hydrogenate to naphthenes: benzene + 3H₂ → cyclohexane (improves cetane number, reduces soot, but consumes H₂ - severity controlled by temperature, pressure). Typical: reduce aromatics from 30% to 20-25% (balance cetane vs H₂ cost). **Operating conditions:** Temperature 330-380°C (higher T = faster reaction but more coking), pressure 35-80 bar (higher P = better sulfur removal, deeper aromatic saturation), LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) 1-3 h⁻¹ (diesel volume per catalyst volume per hour, lower = longer residence, better desulfurization). H₂ consumption: 30-100 Nm³/m³ diesel (deep desulfurization to <10 ppm requires 80-100 Nm³/m³). Reactor exotherm: HDS reactions release heat (ΔH ≈ -70 kJ/mol S removed), temperature rise 20-50°C through bed (manage with H₂ quench streams between beds, cold H₂ injection cools gas/liquid mixture).

**Step 71-95: Product Separation and H₂S Removal**
Reactor effluent: 360-400°C, 30-70 bar, mixture of diesel, hydrogen, H₂S, NH₃, light hydrocarbons (cracked from overtreatment). **High-pressure separator:** Cool to 40-60°C (air or water-cooled heat exchanger), separate gas from liquid. Liquid: hydrotreated diesel (low sulfur). Gas: H₂ (85-90%), H₂S (2-10%), light hydrocarbons (C1-C4, 3-8%). **Amine treating:** H₂S-rich gas bubbles through amine solution (MDEA methyldiethanolamine 30-50% in water, or DEA diethanolamine, absorber column 10-30 trays, 40-50°C, 20-40 bar). H₂S dissolves: H₂S + RNH₂ ⇌ RNH₃⁺ + HS⁻. Clean H₂ (>95% purity, <100 ppm H₂S) recycled to hydrotreater (makeup fresh H₂ from steam reformer compensates consumption). Rich amine (H₂S-loaded) to stripper column (heat to 110-125°C, release H₂S gas, regenerate lean amine). **Claus sulfur recovery plant:** Concentrated H₂S (30-90%) combusts with air: H₂S + 1.5O₂ → SO₂ + H₂O (thermal furnace 1,000-1,400°C, one-third H₂S burns). Remaining H₂S reacts with SO₂: 2H₂S + SO₂ → 3S + 2H₂O (Claus reaction, 950°C thermal then 200-350°C over alumina or titanium oxide catalyst, 2-3 stages). Elemental sulfur condenses (liquid at 120-160°C, solidifies at 115°C). Recovery: 95-98% of H₂S converted to sulfur (tail gas <2-5% H₂S, further treated in SCOT or tail gas incinerator, convert to SO₂, scrub with caustic). Sulfur: bright yellow solid, prills or blocks, stored molten (140-160°C in insulated tanks), ships as liquid (railcars, trucks) or solid. Market: fertilizer (sulfuric acid → phosphoric acid → ammonium phosphate), chemical feedstock. Diesel sulfur removed: 0.5-1.5% feed → 5,000-15,000 ppm → hydrotreating → <15 ppm ULSD (99.9% removal). Large refinery (200,000 bbl/day): 50-200 tonnes/day sulfur recovered.

**Step 96-120: Diesel Blending and Additives**
Hydrotreated diesel base stock: <15 ppm S, 20-25% aromatics, cetane 48-53, density 830-850 kg/m³. Blend with other streams to meet specifications. **Blend components:** (1) Straight-run hydrotreated diesel (60-85% of blend, main component). (2) Light cycle oil (LCO) from fluid catalytic cracker (10-20%, high aromatics 60-80%, low cetane 20-30, cheap but degrades blend quality, limit to 10-15%). (3) Hydrocracked diesel (5-15%, from heavy gas oil hydrocracker, excellent quality, high cetane 55-65, low aromatics, expensive). (4) Coker diesel (0-10%, from delayed coker, poor quality, high olefins/aromatics, requires hydrotreating). (5) Kerosene (0-5%, adjust flash point, cold flow properties). **Diesel specifications (ASTM D975, EN 590):** Cetane number ≥40 (US Grade 2D), ≥51 (EN 590 European), measure in CFR engine (ASTM D613) or by cetane index calculation (ASTM D4737, from density + distillation, index = -420.34 + 0.016 × API gravity² + ...). Sulfur: ≤15 ppm (ULSD US), ≤10 ppm (EU). Distillation: T90 (90% recovered) <282-338°C (controls tail, heavy ends). Flash point ≥52°C (safety, fire hazard). Cloud point: -5 to +5°C (wax crystallization temperature, winter operability, varies by climate). Pour point: -10 to 0°C (fuel stops flowing). Cold filter plugging point (CFPP): -5 to -20°C (max temperature wax plugs filter, critical spec for winter diesel). Lubricity: wear scar diameter ≤520 µm (HFRR test, hydrotreating removes natural lubricity compounds, must add lubricity improver). Density: 820-860 kg/m³ (820-845 EN 590, affects fuel economy/emissions). Aromatics: <35% (EU limit), reduce soot emissions. Polyaromatics: <8-11% (carcinogens, soot precursors). Water and sediment: <500 ppm (phase separation, corrosion, microbial growth). Ash: <0.01% (injector deposits). Copper strip corrosion: No. 3 max (non-corrosive). Color: clear to amber, dye red (off-road/heating), green (fuel oil), or undyed (on-road).

**Step 121-145: Diesel Additives for Performance**
Base diesel (hydrotreated blend) requires additives (0.01-0.1% by volume, ~200-1,000 ppm total) for performance, stability, compliance. Treat rates: parts per million (ppm) or grams per metric tonne. **Cetane improvers:** Boost ignition quality (cetane number). 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2-EHN, most common, 0.1-0.5% treat rate, +3 to +6 cetane boost), di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP), isopropyl nitrate. Mechanism: free radical generators, initiate combustion at lower temperature. Cost: $2-5/kg active ingredient, $1-3 per m³ diesel. Mandatory if base cetane <48, target 51-54 finished fuel. **Lubricity improvers:** Hydrotreating removes natural polar compounds (fatty acids, phenols) that lubricate fuel injection pumps. Additives: fatty acid esters (biodiesel, 50-300 ppm), synthetic esters, glycerol oleate. Treat rate: 50-300 ppm (reduces wear scar from 600-700 µm to <460 µm HFRR). Cost: $3-8/kg, $0.20-0.50 per m³. **Cold flow improvers:** Wax (long-chain n-alkanes C18-C28) crystallizes at cold temperature, plugs filters. Additives: ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, polymethacrylates (15-30 carbon side chains mimic wax structure, co-crystallize, modify crystal shape/size, prevent aggregation). Treat rate: 100-500 ppm. Effect: lower CFPP by 3-10°C, pour point by 5-20°C. Cost: $5-15/kg, $0.50-2 per m³. **Detergents/dispersants:** Prevent injector deposits (lacquer, carbon). Polyisobutylene succinimide (PIBSI), polyether amines. Treat rate: 50-300 ppm. Keep injectors clean, maintain spray pattern, reduce emissions. **Antioxidants:** Prevent gum/sediment formation during storage (oxidation of olefins, aromatics). Phenolic antioxidants (2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, BHT), aminic antioxidants. Treat rate: 10-50 ppm. Extend storage stability from 6 months to 1-2 years. **Corrosion inhibitors:** Protect fuel system metals (steel, aluminum) from water, organic acids. Carboxylic acids, imidazolines. Treat rate: 10-50 ppm. **Biocides:** Kill bacteria, fungi that grow in water-diesel interface (tank bottoms). Produce slime, sludge, organic acids (corrosion). Biocides: isothiazolinones, boron compounds. Treat rate: 100-300 ppm (shock treatment when contamination detected). **Demulsifiers:** Promote water separation (water phase sinks to tank bottom, drain periodically). Polyglycols. Treat rate: 5-20 ppm. **Marker dyes:** Tax compliance. Solvent Red 26 (red dye, 3-5 ppm) for off-road/heating diesel (untaxed, illegal in on-road vehicles). **Total additive package:** Blended "diesel performance additive" (DPA) contains 5-10 components, dosed 200-1,000 ppm. Cost: $0.50-3 per m³ diesel. Inject at terminal rack during loading, or in-line blend at refinery.

**Step 146-170: Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) - Regulatory and Technical**
Historical context: Diesel sulfur limits tightened to reduce emissions (sulfur combusts → SO₂ → acid rain, particulates, health effects). Pre-1993: 5,000 ppm S (0.5%). 1993-2006: 500 ppm "low sulfur diesel" (LSD, EPA Highway Diesel Rule). 2006-2010: 15 ppm ULSD (99.7% reduction, EPA Heavy-Duty Highway Rule phased June 2006 on-road, 2010 off-road/locomotive/marine). Europe: EN 590 10 ppm since 2009. Benefits: (1) Enable advanced emissions controls (diesel particulate filters DPF, SCR selective catalytic reduction urea injection for NOx). Sulfur poisons DPF catalysts (platinum, palladium), blinds SCR catalysts (vanadium, zeolite). (2) Reduce direct SO₂ emissions 97% (vs 500 ppm LSD). (3) Lower PM2.5 particulate matter 10-20% (sulfates contribute to PM mass). (4) Enable Euro 4, 5, 6, US EPA 2007/2010 emission standards (NOx <0.2-0.4 g/kWh, PM <0.01 g/kWh, impossible without ULSD). **ULSD refining challenges:** Deep desulfurization (500 → 15 ppm) requires severe hydrotreating (higher H₂ pressure 60-80 bar, higher temperature 370-390°C, lower space velocity, more catalyst volume). Refractory sulfur compounds: 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT, methyl groups block sulfur atom from catalyst surface, sterically hindered, accounts for 50-70% of sulfur remaining at 50 ppm, requires extreme conditions or new catalysts). **Advanced hydrotreating catalysts:** CoMo or NiMo on high-surface alumina (250-350 m²/g), fluorinated supports (displace Al-OH, increase acidity, enhance activity), stacked beds (guard bed → bulk desulfurization bed → ultra-deep bed with specialty catalyst). H₂ consumption increases: 40 Nm³/m³ for 500 ppm → 80-120 Nm³/m³ for 10-15 ppm (30-50% of refinery H₂ demand for diesel production). Octane/cetane loss: Over-hydrogenation saturates aromatics to naphthenes (cetane improves, but yield loss as light ends crack, density drops below spec, 1-3% volume loss). Lubricity loss: Polar compounds removed (fatty acids, nitrogen heterocycles), requires lubricity additive. Capital investment: Retrofit existing hydrotreaters or build new units ($100-500M per refinery), H₂ plant expansion ($200-400M for 50-100 MMscfd H₂). Refineries phased compliance 2006-2009 (on-road terminals first, off-road later). Price premium: ULSD initially $0.02-0.05/L more than LSD (2006-2007), converged as LSD phased out (now all on-road diesel is ULSD, LSD obsolete). Heating oil: Residential heating oil transitioned to ULSD 2012-2014 (Northeast US, most other regions earlier, reduces sulfur emissions from furnaces).

**Step 171-185: Cetane Number - Ignition Quality Measurement**
Cetane number (CN): measure of diesel ignition quality, analogous to octane number for gasoline (but inverse - higher is better). Definition: Ignition delay in compression-ignition engine. High cetane → short delay → smooth combustion. Low cetane → long delay → rough, knocking combustion, hard starting, white smoke. **Cetane scale:** n-hexadecane (cetane, C₁₆H₃₄, straight-chain paraffin) assigned CN = 100 (excellent ignition, short delay). Heptamethylnonane (HMN, highly branched C₁₆, or alpha-methylnaphthalene, aromatic) assigned CN = 15 (poor ignition, long delay). Blend these reference fuels, measure ignition delay in standardized engine (ASTM D613 CFR Cetane Engine). **Typical cetane numbers:** Straight-run diesel (hydrotreated): 48-53 CN. n-paraffins (straight-chain): 55-100 CN (C16 = 100, C12 = 87, C20 = 110 extrapolated). iso-paraffins (branched): 30-60 CN (branching lowers cetane). Naphthenes (cycloalkanes): 40-60 CN. Aromatics: 0-40 CN (benzene ≈20, naphthalene ≈0, polyaromatics <10). Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters): 50-65 CN (high, excellent ignition). **Cetane index:** Calculated from density and distillation (ASTM D4737, D976), correlates with measured CN ±2-3 units. Used for quality control (engine test slow/expensive). Formula: CI = 45.2 + (0.0892)(T10) + [0.131 + (0.901)(B)] × [log(T10)]² + ... (where T10 = 10% distillation temperature °C, B = specific gravity correction). **Minimum specifications:** US ASTM D975 Grade 2-D: CN ≥40 (some states require 45+, California CARB diesel 53+ for emissions). EN 590 Europe: CN ≥51. Japan JIS K2204: CN ≥50. Effect on engine: CN <40 → rough idle, white smoke, hard cold starting, engine knock, NOx emissions increase. CN >55 → smooth, quiet, reduced NOx, but may increase PM slightly (combustion timing shift). **Cetane improvement:** Blend high-cetane components (hydrocracked diesel, biodiesel 5-20%), add cetane improver additive (2-EHN +5 CN per 0.1% dose), reduce aromatic content (hydrotreating severity, avoid LCO/coker blending). Cetane improver cost-effective: $1-2/m³ diesel for +3-5 CN vs capital to build hydrocracker ($1-2 billion).

**Step 186-195: Diesel Fuel Applications, Market, and Pricing**
Global diesel production: 1.4 billion tonnes/year (28 million barrels/day, 1.2 trillion liters/year, 2023). Largest fuel by volume (gasoline 1.3 billion tonnes, diesel overtook ~2005 due to dieselization of Europe, Asia, truck transport growth). **Applications by sector:** On-road transportation (55%, 770 Mt/year): heavy-duty trucks (freight, 18-wheelers, Class 7-8, 30-40 mpg load-ton-mile efficiency vs 15-20 for gasoline trucks), delivery vans, buses (transit, school, intercity), light-duty diesel cars (popular in Europe 30-40% of passenger cars, rare in US <3% after VW scandal, 45-65 mpg fuel economy). Off-road equipment (20%, 280 Mt): construction (excavators, bulldozers, cranes), mining (haul trucks, loaders, drills), agriculture (tractors, combines, irrigation pumps). Rail (5%, 70 Mt): diesel-electric locomotives (freight, passenger where not electrified). Marine (10%, 140 Mt): ships (container, bulk, tanker, diesel engines 2-stroke low-speed or 4-stroke medium-speed, heavy fuel oil blends or marine gas oil MGO). Military (2%, 28 Mt): tanks, vehicles, generators (JP-8 jet fuel often used, similar to diesel). Stationary power (5%, 70 Mt): backup generators (hospitals, data centers, telecom), prime power (remote sites, islands, off-grid), peak shaving. Heating oil (3%, 42 Mt): residential/commercial furnaces (Northeast US, declining, switching to natural gas or heat pumps). **Regional consumption:** Asia-Pacific 40% (China 15%, India 8%, Japan 5%), Europe 25% (Germany 5%, France 3%, UK 2%), North America 20% (USA 15%, Mexico 3%, Canada 2%), Middle East 7%, Latin America 5%, Africa 3%. **Price:** Wholesale: $0.65-1.20/L ($550-950/tonne, 2010-2024 range, tracks crude oil $50-120/barrel Brent). Retail on-road US: $0.80-1.50/L ($3.00-5.50/gallon, includes $0.15-0.30/L taxes federal + state). Europe retail: €1.20-1.80/L ($1.30-2.00/L, includes €0.50-0.80/L excise + VAT). Off-road diesel (red-dyed, untaxed): $0.05-0.15/L cheaper. Heating oil: similar to off-road, sometimes lower sulfur premium. **Cost structure (refiner margin):** Crude oil 80-85% ($450/tonne at $75/barrel), refining 8-12% ($50-80/tonne), distribution/marketing 3-5% ($20-30/tonne), taxes variable (US $0.15/L = $120/tonne, EU $0.60/L = $500/tonne). **Diesel vs gasoline economics:** Diesel 5-8% more expensive at refinery gate (more processing - hydrotreating, higher H₂ cost). But 10-15% better fuel economy (higher energy density 36.9 vs 32.4 MJ/L, higher thermodynamic efficiency 40-45% vs 25-30% for gasoline engines). Total cost per km: diesel competitive for high-mileage fleets (trucks, taxis). **Future outlook:** Peak diesel demand 2030-2035 (IEA projection), decline as electric trucks (BEV, fuel cell), stricter NOx/PM regulations (Euro 7, EPA post-2027), carbon pricing. Diesel share declining in passenger cars (Europe dieselization reversing post-Dieselgate 2015, 30% → 15% new sales), but growing in freight, off-road (hard to electrify heavy-duty). Renewable diesel/HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil, "green diesel") from fats/oils, chemically identical to fossil diesel, blended or neat, reduces CO₂ 50-90%, premium price $0.20-0.50/L.

Price: $0.85/kg represents wholesale ultra-low sulfur diesel at refinery gate or terminal rack, typical contract price $700-900/tonne ($0.80-1.00/L at 850 kg/m³ density). Retail adds distribution, marketing, taxes. Used in: heavy-duty trucks (Freightliner, Volvo, Scania 12-16L engines, 400-600 HP, 1-2 MPG loaded), buses, construction equipment (Caterpillar, Komatsu, John Deere), agriculture, rail, marine, backup power, heating. Per km truck freight: 0.25-0.35 L/km (loaded semi-truck) → $0.20-0.35 diesel cost per km.
