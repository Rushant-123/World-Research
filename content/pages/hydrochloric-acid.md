# How to Make Hydrochloric Acid

**Top Market Leaders:**
- [Dow](/companies/dow)
- [BASF](/companies/basf)
- [Olin](/companies/olin)



Strong acid (HCl). Two methods: **Direct synthesis** (H₂ + Cl₂) or **Byproduct** from chlorination reactions.

## Direct Synthesis:
1. [Hydrogen Gas](hydrogen-gas) + [Chlorine Gas](chlorine-production) → [Reactor](hcl-reactor)
2. H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl (exothermic, releases heat)
3. Reaction in burner produces HCl gas
4. Absorb HCl gas in [Water](water-supply) in [Absorption Tower](gas-scrubber)
5. HCl dissolves: HCl(g) + H₂O → H⁺ + Cl⁻
6. Concentration: 30-37% (concentrated HCl, "muriatic acid")

**Uses:** Steel pickling, pH control, semiconductor etching, silicone production. Reagent-grade: 99.999% purity. Price: $100-300/ton (32%).
