# How to Make Coal

Fossil fuel - sedimentary rock from buried plant matter (300-50 million years ago, Carboniferous to Tertiary periods). Uses: electricity generation (40% of coal, declining), steelmaking coking coal (15%), cement production (5%), industrial heat/chemicals (3%), residential heating (declining), other 2%. Global production: 8.5 billion tonnes/year (2023, 8,000 Mt hard coal, 500 Mt lignite). China dominates: 50% of production and consumption. Mining: surface (40%) or underground (60%).

**Step 1-20: Formation and Coal Rank**
Coal: accumulation of plant material (trees, ferns, mosses in ancient swamps) → peat (partially decayed organic matter) → buried by sediments → heat + pressure over millions of years → coalification (drives off volatiles, increases carbon content). **Coal rank progression:** (1) **Peat** (precursor, not coal, 50-60% C, 40-50% H₂O moisture, recent 100-10,000 years, Ireland, Russia, Canada, Indonesia bogs, harvested as fuel in rural areas, 0.4 Gt/year). (2) **Lignite** (brown coal, 60-70% C, 25-45% moisture, low heating value 10-20 MJ/kg, Tertiary 50-20 Mya, Germany, Australia, USA Texas/Dakota, burn directly at power plants near mine, crumbles when dry, not suitable for transport). (3) **Sub-bituminous** (70-80% C, 15-30% moisture, 18-25 MJ/kg, major USA western deposits Powder River Basin Wyoming, low sulfur 0.3-0.7%, thermal power generation). (4) **Bituminous** (80-90% C, 2-15% moisture, 24-35 MJ/kg, most common globally, Pennsylvanian-Permian 320-250 Mya, USA Appalachia, China, Australia, Russia, India, thermal and coking coal). (5) **Anthracite** (90-95% C, 1-5% moisture, 30-33 MJ/kg, hard, glossy black, rare <1% of reserves, Pennsylvania, China, Ukraine, slow-burning smokeless fuel, metallurgical, high-value). **Coalification drivers:** Temperature (geothermal gradient 25-30°C per km depth, 100-200°C promotes coalification, >300°C generates petroleum/gas). Pressure (burial depth 1-5 km, compaction). Time (Carboniferous coals 300 Mya typically bituminous, Tertiary <50 Mya lignite, exceptions exist if deep burial rapid).

**Step 21-45: Exploration and Reserve Assessment**
Locate coal seams: outcrop mapping (surface exposures eroded valleys), drill core sampling (rotary or diamond drills, 50-500m depth, 50-75mm core diameter, log lithology thickness ash content), geophysical surveys (seismic reflection delineates seam depth/extent, resistivity detects coal vs shale). **Coal seam characteristics:** Thickness: 0.5-30m (thin <1m difficult to mine, thick >5m economical, Australia Bowen Basin seams 5-10m, Powder River Basin Wyoming 20-70m seams among world's thickest). Depth: surface to 1,500m (surface mining economical if overburden <100m, strip ratio <20:1, underground mining 50-1,200m depths, deeper = higher cost, geotechnical risks). **Quality parameters:** Proximate analysis: moisture (5-40%), ash (inorganic minerals SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, CaO, 5-30%), volatile matter (hydrocarbons released on heating, 15-45%, high volatiles = easier ignition), fixed carbon (remaining C after volatiles, 40-80%). Ultimate analysis: carbon 60-95%, hydrogen 3-6%, oxygen 2-20%, nitrogen 1-2%, sulfur 0.3-5% (environmental concern, low-S <1% premium, high-S >2% requires scrubbing). Heating value: 10-35 MJ/kg (air-dried basis, Btu 4,500-15,000 per lb). **Reserves:** Proven 1.1 trillion tonnes (USA 249 Gt 23%, Russia 162 Gt 15%, Australia 149 Gt 14%, China 139 Gt 13%, India 106 Gt 10%, others 295 Gt 25%). Resources (less certain): 10+ trillion tonnes. Reserves-to-production ratio: 130 years at current rates.

**Step 46-70: [Surface Mining](strip-mining) - Stripping and Dragline**
Surface (open-pit, strip, opencast) mining: economical if coal seam <100m deep, overburden removal exposes coal. **Overburden removal:** Topsoil (0.5-2m, stockpile separately for reclamation). Overburden (soil, rock, shale, sandstone, 5-100m above coal seam). **Dragline method:** Massive excavator (100-200m boom, 40-170 m³ bucket, 2,000-14,000 tonne machine, largest Big Muskie 13,500 tonnes demolished 1999, Bagger 293 Germany largest 14,200 tonnes). Dragline casts bucket 100m, drags overburden, swings, deposits in previously mined pit (spoil piles). Productivity: 100,000-300,000 bank cubic meters per month (1-3 Mt overburden, strip ratio 5-15:1 common). Expose coal seam: 20-70m thick Powder River Basin seams allow single-pass mining. **Truck-shovel method:** Drill-blast overburden (rotary drills 310-450mm, ANFO explosive 0.3-0.6 kg/m³). Load with shovel (30-80 m³ buckets, hydraulic or electric rope) into haul trucks (200-400 tonne, Caterpillar 797, Komatsu 980E). Haul to external spoil dumps or backfill mined areas. More flexible than dragline (variable pit geometry, harder rock), lower productivity per unit capex. **Coal extraction:** Front-end loaders (10-30 m³) or smaller shovels load coal into trucks (separate fleet from overburden to prevent contamination). Haul to preparation plant (0.5-10 km). Production: large surface mines 10-100 Mt/year (Powder River Basin mines North Antelope Rochelle 100 Mt/year largest USA mine, Hunter Valley Australia 20-40 Mt/year operations).

**Step 71-95: [Underground Mining](longwall-mining) Methods**
Underground: coal seam >100m deep or steep topography (mountains) where surface mining impractical. Two methods: room-and-pillar (40%) and longwall (60%). **Room-and-pillar:** Drive entries (tunnels 5-7m wide, 2-4m tall) into seam in grid pattern, leave pillars (coal columns 15-30m × 15-30m, support roof, 40-60% coal remains in place). Mine coal with continuous miner (rotating drum with tungsten carbide picks, cuts coal 3-5 tonnes/min, loads onto shuttle car or conveyor). Retreat mining: extract pillars on retreat (roof collapses behind, increase recovery to 60-75%). Advantages: flexible, lower capex $50-200M, suitable for thin seams 1-3m, irregular geology. Disadvantages: lower recovery, subsidence risk if pillar extraction. **[Longwall mining](longwall-mining):** Continuous mining face 150-300m wide, shearer (electric cutter-loader, 400-700 kW, 2m diameter rotating drums) traverses face on armored face conveyor (AFC, 150-300m long). Shearer cuts coal in passes (2-10 m/day advance rate, 3,000-10,000 tonnes/day from single face). Hydraulic roof supports (powered shields, 100-175 units, each 1.5m wide, advance after each pass, controlled subsidence as shields advance roof caves behind, "controlled caving" subsides surface 0.5-3m eventually). Conveyor system: AFC → stage loader → belt conveyors → shaft/slope to surface (2-8 km). Productivity: 2-5 Mt/year per longwall panel (panel dimensions 150-300m wide × 1,000-4,000m long, mine 1-3 years, develop next panel in parallel). Advantages: high recovery 70-90%, mechanized, safe (workers protected under shields), economies of scale. Disadvantages: high capex $200-800M (shearer $15-30M, shields $300-500k each, conveyors, ventilation), inflexible (commit to panel direction 1-3 years), requires thick uniform seams >1.5m.

**Step 96-118: Ventilation and Safety**
Underground hazards: methane gas (CH₄, coal seams release 5-25 m³ CH₄ per tonne coal mined, explosive 5-15% concentration, colorless odorless, Davy safety lamp historic detection, now continuous monitors), coal dust (respirable particles <10 µm, coal workers' pneumoconiosis "black lung" from chronic exposure, 50,000+ deaths USA historically, <2 mg/m³ exposure limit), roof falls (most common accident, geotechnical failure if pillars inadequate, ground control plans required). **Ventilation:** Force fresh air through mine (main fan 500-5,000 kW, surface installation, 100-1,000 m³/s flow rate). Air splits: direct air through active working areas (separate intake and return airways, 0.5-2 m/s face velocity dilutes methane <1% volume). Methane drainage: pre-drain seam with boreholes (extract CH₄ before mining, 30-80% of gas removed, pure CH₄ 95-98% captured, use as fuel for power generation "coal mine methane CMM" or vent if insufficient volume). **Roof support:** Rock bolts (steel rods 1.5-3m long, resin or mechanical anchors, bolt roof to stable strata above, prevent delamination). Screen/mesh (steel or synthetic fiber, catch loose rock between bolts). Longwall shields (hydraulic set pressure 400-800 tonnes per shield, 5-8 bar hydraulic pressure, resist overburden weight). **Escape and rescue:** Self-contained self-rescuers (SCSR, 30-60 min oxygen supply, activate if fire/gas, evacuate to surface or refuge chamber). Refuge chambers (airtight rooms, compressed air, food, water, communications, sustain 10-20 miners 48-96 hours if egress blocked). Mine rescue teams (trained in firefighting, gas detection, first aid, response times <1 hour surface, 2-4 hours underground depending on depth).

**Step 119-140: [Coal Preparation](wash-plant) (Beneficiation)**
Raw coal (run-of-mine ROM) contaminated with rock, shale, clay, pyrite (FeS₂, 1-15% of ROM depending on mining selectivity). Preparation plant (wash plant) upgrades coal: remove impurities, size classification, blend to meet customer specs. **Crushing:** Jaw crusher or roll crusher reduce ROM 500mm → 150mm. Screen: separate size fractions (+150mm, 150-50mm, 50-10mm, -10mm). **Dense media separation (coarse coal):** +50mm and 50-10mm fractions treated separately. Immerse coal in heavy media (magnetite Fe₃O₄ powder + water suspension, density 1.4-1.8 g/cm³, intermediate between coal 1.2-1.5 and rock 2.2-2.8). Coal floats (lower density), rock sinks. Cyclones (centrifugal force enhances separation, 15-30 seconds residence). Drain and rinse: clean coal (low-ash) and reject (high-ash rock). Magnetite recovery: magnetic separators recover 98-99.5% of magnetite, recycle to circuit (makeup 0.1-0.5 kg/tonne coal). **Froth flotation (fine coal):** -10mm to -0.5mm particles too small for dense media. Add collector reagent (diesel or kerosene 0.5-2 kg/tonne, adsorbs on coal, makes hydrophobic) + frother (MIBC methyl isobutyl carbinol 0.1-0.5 kg/tonne). Air bubbles attach to coal, float to surface (froth layer 10-30 cm thick, overflows). Shale, clay sink (tailings). **Dewatering:** Screen (static or vibrating, remove free water 20-30% moisture). Centrifuge (fine coal <1mm, spin at 1,000-3,000 rpm, 10-15% moisture). Filter press (ultra-fine -0.5mm, 25-35% moisture). Thermal dryer (fluidized bed or rotary, natural gas or waste heat, 5-10% moisture for export coal, $5-15/tonne cost). **Yield:** Clean coal recovery 60-90% of ROM (depends on ROM ash 15-40%, target product ash 8-15% thermal coal, 7-10% coking coal). Reject: 10-40% as tailings (high-ash rock, pyrite, clay, slurry to impoundment dam or paste backfill underground voids).

**Step 141-160: Coal Quality and Specifications**
**Thermal coal (power generation, 85% of market):** Ash 8-20% (mineral matter, inert, reduces heating value, increases transport cost, boiler slagging). Sulfur <1% preferred (low-S premium, high-S requires flue gas desulfurization FGD, SO₂ emissions limits). Moisture 5-20% (sub-bituminous 20-30% as-mined, dry to 10-15% for export). Heating value: 24-28 MJ/kg (6,000-7,000 kcal/kg, international trade benchmark 6,000 kcal/kg GAR gross as-received). Volatile matter 20-35% (bituminous typical). Chlorine <0.3% (boiler corrosion). Size: -50mm crushed (power plant pulverizers grind to 75 µm for combustion). **Coking coal (metallurgical, 15% of market):** Premium grade for steelmaking. Ash 7-10%, sulfur <0.6%, volatile matter 18-30% (mid-vol preferred, high-vol >30% expands excessively, low-vol <18% poor caking). Crucially: coking properties (coke strength after reaction CSR >55, coke reactivity CRI <30, Gieseler plastometer measures fluidity, Arnu dilatometer measures swelling, crucible swelling number 5-8 ideal). Form coke: heat coal 1,000-1,100°C in absence of air (destructive distillation, drive off volatiles tar/gas, carbon fuses into porous solid coke 85-90% fixed carbon, 10-15% ash). Coke blast furnace fuel and reducing agent: 450-550 kg coke per tonne pig iron. Major producing basins: Australia Queensland (50 Mt/year coking coal), USA Appalachia (30 Mt), Russia Kuzbass, Canada British Columbia, Mozambique Moatize. Price: $150-500/tonne FOB (vs thermal $50-200/tonne), cyclical with steel demand. **PCI coal (pulverized coal injection):** Inject directly into blast furnace (replace 30-40% of coke, cheaper). Specs: low ash <12%, low S <0.8%, high volatile 25-35%, grindability HGI >50.

**Step 161-175: Transportation - Rail, Barge, Ship**
Coal: low value-to-weight (thermal $50-200/tonne, coking $150-500/tonne vs oil $400-800/tonne), minimize transport cost. **Rail (60% of coal transport):** Unit trains (100-150 cars × 100 tonne per car = 10,000-15,000 tonnes, dedicated shuttle mine-to-plant or port, 1-3 day round trip). USA: Wyoming Powder River Basin → Midwest power plants 1,500-2,500 km, $0.01-0.03/tonne·km ($15-75/tonne freight). China: Shanxi/Inner Mongolia (production) → coastal ports 1,000-2,000 km, heavily congested. Australia: Queensland coal railways 200-400 km mine to export terminals Gladstone/Abbot Point/Hay Point, electrified heavy-haul (30-tonne axle loads). **Barge/river (10%):** Mississippi, Ohio rivers USA (cheaper $0.005-0.015/tonne·km but limited to waterway locations). China Yangtze River. Europe Rhine River. Typical barge: 1,500-3,000 tonnes. **Truck (20%):** Short haul mine to plant <100 km ($0.10-0.30/tonne·km, uneconomical long distance). India: many small mines, truck to local consumers. **Seaborne trade (15% of production, 1.2 Gt/year):** Export thermal coal: Indonesia 450 Mt (world's largest exporter, sub-bituminous 4,000-5,500 kcal/kg to China/India/Japan), Australia 200 Mt (high-quality 5,500-6,500 kcal/kg), Russia 200 Mt, USA 50 Mt, Colombia 60 Mt, South Africa 70 Mt. Coking coal exports: Australia 180 Mt, USA 40 Mt, Canada 30 Mt. Import: China 300 Mt (though domestic 3.9 Gt, imports supplement coastal demand), India 250 Mt, Japan 190 Mt (100% imported, no domestic production), South Korea 130 Mt, Taiwan 70 Mt, Europe 150 Mt. Ships: Capesize (120,000-180,000 DWT, major routes Australia/Indonesia→China/India), Panamax (60,000-80,000 DWT). Freight: $5-40/tonne (volatile, 2008 peak $140/tonne, 2016 low $3/tonne). Loading: shiploaders at export terminals (10,000-16,000 tph, Gladstone Australia 85 Mt/year capacity, Newcastle largest coal port 165 Mt/year).

**Step 176-185: Environmental and Health Impacts**
**Mining impacts:** Surface mining: habitat destruction (mountaintop removal Appalachia, valley fills bury streams, 2,000+ km² disturbed), acid mine drainage (pyrite oxidation FeS₂ + O₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₄ + Fe(OH)₃, pH 2-4, dissolves heavy metals, perpetual treatment required decades after closure), dust (PM10 respiratory, water trucks suppress roads). Underground: subsidence (ground surface sinks 0.5-3m, cracks buildings, alters hydrology), methane emissions (0.5-2% of coal mined released as CH₄, GWP 28× CO₂ over 100 years, equivalent to 50-200 Mt CO₂e per year). Water: dewatering lowers aquifers (1-10 million L/day per large mine), discharge contains TDS, sulfate, selenium (treatment required, selenium <5 ppb limit very difficult, reverse osmosis or biological reduction). **Combustion emissions:** CO₂: 2.2-2.4 kg CO₂ per kg coal (sub-bituminous 2.0, anthracite 2.5, average ~2.2), coal power 900-1,000 g CO₂/kWh vs gas 400-450 g/kWh. Global coal combustion: 8 Gt coal/year → 16 Gt CO₂ (40% of energy-related emissions). SO₂: uncontrolled 10-40 kg SO₂/tonne coal (S content 0.5-2%), acid rain, scrubbers (FGD wet limestone 90-98% removal or dry sorbent 70-90%) reduce to <0.1 kg/tonne. NOₓ: 2-10 kg/tonne (thermal NOₓ from combustion air at 1,400-1,700°C), SCR (selective catalytic reduction) with ammonia reduces 80-90%. Particulates: fly ash 5-30 kg/tonne coal (uncontrolled), ESPs (electrostatic precipitators 99.5-99.9% removal) or bag houses (99.9%+). Mercury: 0.05-0.2 ppm in coal, volatilizes, bioaccumulates (fish contamination), activated carbon injection captures 70-90%. Coal ash: 80-200 kg/tonne coal (fly ash 80%, bottom ash 20%), 1.5 Gt/year global, disposal in ponds (spills: Kingston TN 2008, 4.1 million m³ ash sludge, Dan River NC 2014), use in concrete/cement (30-40% beneficially used, remainder landfills).

**Step 186-195: Market, Pricing, and Decline Outlook**
Global coal: 8.5 Gt/year production (2023). China 4.5 Gt (53%, production & consumption), India 980 Mt (12%), Indonesia 770 Mt (9%, mostly export), USA 580 Mt (7%, declining from 1.1 Gt peak 2008), Australia 570 Mt (7%), Russia 480 Mt (6%), South Africa 270 Mt (3%), other 2.4 Gt (23%). **Consumption by sector:** Power generation 5.9 Gt (69%, declining in OECD +5%/year in developing Asia), steel 1.3 Gt coking coal (15%), cement/industrial 0.8 Gt (9%), residential/other 0.5 Gt (6%). **Prices:** Thermal coal $50-200/tonne FOB (Newcastle 6,000 kcal/kg benchmark $80-150/tonne 2020-2024, spiked $400/tonne 2022 energy crisis, crashed $50-80/tonne 2023 oversupply). Coking coal $150-500/tonne (Australia premium low-vol $200-350 typical, spiked $600/tonne 2022). Domestic prices vary: China $50-120/tonne (regulated), India $60-100, USA $25-60 (Powder River Basin sub-bituminous), Appalachia $50-80. **Production costs:** Surface mining $20-60/tonne (Wyoming $15-25 lowest-cost, Australia $30-50, Indonesia $30-40). Underground $40-120/tonne (longwall $50-80, room-pillar $60-100, deeper/thinner seams higher). Marginal high-cost production $80-150/tonne (sets price floor, low-price periods shut marginal mines). **Decline drivers:** Climate policy (Paris Agreement, net-zero commitments, coal phase-out Germany by 2038, UK 2024 last plant closed, USA coal generation 50% of electricity 2005 → 20% 2023 → <5% projected 2035, China peak coal 2025-2030 target). Renewables (solar/wind LCOE $20-60/MWh vs coal $60-150/MWh new-build, battery storage displacing peaking coal). Stranded assets: $1-4 trillion coal infrastructure at risk (plants close before end of life, mining investments unrecoverable). India, China, Southeast Asia still building coal (600 GW under construction/planned, lock-in 2030-2050 emissions), but financing difficult (banks/investors ESG restrictions, OECD export credit agencies restrict coal finance).

Price: $0.08/kg ($80/tonne) represents mid-range thermal coal price (Newcastle 6,000 kcal benchmark). Range $50-400/tonne depending on quality (sub-bituminous 4,500 kcal $40-80, bituminous 6,000 kcal $70-150, premium 6,500+ kcal $100-200, coking coal $150-500). Used in: electricity generation (pulverize, burn in boiler, 900-1,000 g CO₂/kWh), steelmaking (coking coal → coke → blast furnace, 450-550 kg coke per tonne steel, carbon source + fuel), cement (kiln fuel, 120-200 kg coal per tonne clinker), industrial heat (brick kilns, chemical plants). Per tonne steel (integrated mill): 0.6-0.8 tonnes coking coal → coke → $90-400 coal cost depending on grade. Per MWh electricity (coal plant): 0.35-0.45 tonnes coal → $28-90 fuel cost, dominates power cost economics.
