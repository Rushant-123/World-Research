# How to Make GitHub

**Market Leader:** [GitHub (Microsoft)](/companies/github-microsoft)



GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. It was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett, and acquired by Microsoft in 2018.

## What is it?

A cloud-hosted service that provides Git repository hosting, code review tools, issue tracking, project management, and social coding features. It stores code in [Git Software](git-software) repositories and adds a web interface for collaboration. GitHub hosts open-source projects for free and charges for private repositories and advanced features.

## Steps to Make:

1. Start with [Git Software](git-software) as the foundation for version control
2. Set up [Data Center](data-center) infrastructure to host the service
3. Install [Web Server](web-server) software to handle HTTP requests
4. Set up [Database Server](database-server) to store user data, repositories metadata, and relationships
5. Use [Software Engineers](software-engineers) to build the platform
6. Build the backend using [Ruby on Rails](ruby-on-rails) framework
7. Design the web interface using [HTML Language](html) for structure
8. Style the interface using [CSS Language](css) for visual design
9. Add interactivity using [JavaScript](javascript) for dynamic features
10. Implement user authentication and authorization systems
11. Create Git server infrastructure that accepts push/pull operations
12. Build web UI for browsing repositories and viewing code
13. Implement pull request system for code review
14. Add issue tracking for bug reports and feature requests
15. Build collaboration features (comments, mentions, notifications)
16. Add project management tools (boards, milestones)
17. Implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
18. Create API for programmatic access
19. Set up [Internet Connection](internet-connection) for global access
20. Register [Domain Name](domain-registration) github.com
21. Connect servers to the internet backbone
22. Implement security features (2FA, SSH keys, access controls)
23. Build mobile apps for iOS and Android
24. Scale infrastructure to handle millions of users
25. Add GitHub Pages for free website hosting
26. Continuously update features and maintain infrastructure

The result is a web platform where developers can host code repositories, collaborate on projects, review code, track issues, and automate workflows. Free for public repositories, with paid plans for private repos and advanced features.
