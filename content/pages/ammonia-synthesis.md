# How to Make Ammonia (NH₃)

Foundation chemical - most produced synthetic chemical worldwide (175 million tonnes/year, 2023). 80% for fertilizers, 20% for chemicals (nitric acid, explosives, polymers, refrigerant, semiconductor cleaning). Haber-Bosch process: N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃. Nobel Prize 1918 (Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch). Enabled industrial fertilizer production - supports ~50% of global food supply. Consumes 1-2% of global energy, 1-2% of global CO₂ emissions.

**Step 1-15: [Natural Gas](natural-gas) Feedstock and Desulfurization**
Raw material: natural gas (primarily methane CH₄ 85-95%, ethane C₂H₆ 2-8%, propane C₃H₈ 1-3%, CO₂ 0.5-2%, N₂ 0.5-5%, trace H₂S). Pipeline gas (typical USA/Europe: 95% CH₄, 3% C₂H₆, 1% N₂, <4 ppm H₂S after processing) or associated gas (oil fields, higher C₂+ content). Flow rate: 30-35 million Nm³/day for 1,500 tonne/day NH₃ plant (1 tonne NH₃ requires 21,000-23,000 Nm³ natural gas, 60% as hydrogen source, 40% as fuel). **Desulfurization (critical first step):** Sulfur poisons nickel catalysts (reformer, methanation, forms Ni₃S₂, irreversible deactivation). Remove H₂S (hydrogen sulfide, odor additive, natural contaminant) to <0.1 ppm. **Zinc oxide guard bed:** Natural gas (ambient temperature or preheated to 300-400°C) passes through packed bed of zinc oxide pellets (ZnO, 5-10mm, 10-30 m³ bed volume). Reaction: H₂S + ZnO → ZnS + H₂O (exothermic, irreversible, ZnO converts to black ZnS). Also removes organic sulfur: RSH + ZnO → ZnS + ROH (mercaptans, thiophenes, at higher temperature 300-400°C, hydrogenation pre-step if present). Bed lifetime: 1-5 years (depends on sulfur loading, 10-30 kg S capacity per m³ ZnO), replace when breakthrough (H₂S >0.5 ppm in effluent, monitor with lead acetate paper or online analyzer). Spent bed: dispose as non-hazardous waste or regenerate (oxidize ZnS → ZnO + SO₂, capture SO₂ for sulfuric acid production, economics favorable only for large beds).

**Step 16-40: Primary [Steam Reforming](reformer-furnace) - Hydrogen Generation**
Convert methane to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. **Primary reformer:** Vertical fired furnace, 20-40m tall, 10-20m wide, 15-30m deep. Reformer tubes: 100-200 tubes, 10-15m long, 100-150mm outer diameter, 15-25mm wall thickness, centrifugally cast HK40 alloy (25% Cr, 20% Ni, 0.4% C, withstands 1,050°C, oxidation-resistant, creep-resistant, cost $50-100k per tube). Arranged in parallel rows (top-fired or side-fired burners between tube rows). **Catalyst:** Nickel on alumina support (15-25% Ni, α-Al₂O₃ or calcium aluminate carrier, rings or pellets 10-20mm, bed depth 6-10m per tube, 5-15 tonnes catalyst per tube). Tube loading: load catalyst carefully (avoid breakage, uniform packing, pressure drop 0.5-2 bar across bed). **Feed preparation:** Mix desulfurized natural gas with steam (H₂O:CH₄ molar ratio 2.5-3.5:1, typically 3:1, excess steam favors reaction, suppresses carbon formation). Preheat to 500-650°C in convection section (recover heat from flue gas). **Reforming reactions:** Endothermic, require external heat. CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂ (ΔH = +206 kJ/mol, steam methane reforming SMR, main reaction). CH₄ + 2H₂O → CO₂ + 4H₂ (ΔH = +165 kJ/mol, over-reforming, also occurs). CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂ (ΔH = -41 kJ/mol, water-gas shift WGS, simultaneous, approaches equilibrium). **Operating conditions:** Pressure 25-35 bar (absolute, higher pressure favors methane conversion thermodynamically unfavorable but kinetically faster, balances compression cost vs reactor size), temperature 750-900°C (tube wall 950-1,050°C, catalyst bed 750-850°C, gradient from wall to center, heat transfer limited). Residence time: 1-3 seconds. Methane conversion: 60-75% (equilibrium limited, exit gas 8-20% CH₄, 10-15% CO, 7-10% CO₂, 55-65% H₂, 10-15% H₂O). **Fuel firing:** Burners (natural gas or off-gas from process, 500-1,000 burners per furnace, thermal input 100-250 MW, 35-45% of total natural gas feed combusted as fuel). Combustion air: preheated to 200-400°C (heat recovery from flue gas, increases efficiency). Flue gas: exits at 900-1,100°C, passes through convection section (preheats feed, generates steam), exits stack at 120-200°C. Thermal efficiency: 88-92% (energy in fuel → sensible heat in process gas + steam generation).

**Step 41-62: Secondary Reforming - Nitrogen Injection and Full Conversion**
Complete methane conversion, introduce nitrogen for ammonia stoichiometry. **Secondary reformer:** Refractory-lined vertical vessel, 3-6m diameter, 10-18m tall, carbon steel shell (2-3m refractory lining, alumina or alumina-chrome bricks, withstand 1,200°C). Top: air injection burner (mix air with primary reformer effluent, partial combustion of H₂ and residual CH₄). Middle: combustion zone (exothermic, gas temperature rises from 800°C to 950-1,050°C, provides heat for endothermic reforming). Bottom: catalyst bed (nickel on alumina, 10-50 tonnes, rings or pellets 15-25mm, 2-4m bed depth). **Air injection:** Compressed air (process air compressor, 30-35 bar, 300-500°C preheated, 5,000-15,000 Nm³/h for 1,500 tonne/day plant). Air composition: 78% N₂, 21% O₂. Purpose: (1) Provide N₂ for ammonia (N₂:H₂ ratio after all reactions should be 1:3 molar), (2) Oxidize H₂ and CH₄ to generate heat (O₂ + 2H₂ → 2H₂O, ΔH = -484 kJ/mol, exothermic; CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O, ΔH = -803 kJ/mol). **Combustion:** Oxygen consumes hydrogen preferentially (fast, kinetically favorable). Calculate air flow: add sufficient O₂ to raise temperature to 1,000-1,050°C (O₂:H₂ ratio ~0.2:1 to 0.25:1, not stoichiometric, excess H₂ remains). Post-combustion gas: H₂, N₂, CO, CO₂, H₂O, trace CH₄ (<0.5%, nearly complete conversion in catalyst bed). **Catalyst bed reforming:** High temperature (1,000-1,050°C) drives residual CH₄ reforming to completion (CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂, exit CH₄ <0.3%). Exit gas composition: H₂ 64-68%, N₂ 20-24%, CO 8-13%, CO₂ 4-6%, Ar 0.4-0.6% (from air), CH₄ <0.3%, H₂O 3-5%. Exit temperature: 950-1,050°C (high-grade heat, used for steam generation). H₂:N₂ ratio: ~3:1 (stoichiometric for NH₃ synthesis, calculated based on air injection rate).

**Step 63-82: High-Temperature Shift (HTS) - CO Conversion**
Convert carbon monoxide to hydrogen, reduce CO (poisons ammonia catalyst). **Water-gas shift reaction:** CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂ (exothermic, ΔH = -41 kJ/mol, equilibrium shifts right at lower temperature, but kinetics slower). **HTS reactor:** Vertical vessel, 2-4m diameter, 6-12m tall, carbon steel, refractory-lined (300-500 mm refractory, insulates, maintains 350-500°C). Catalyst: iron-chromium oxide (Fe₃O₄-Cr₂O₃, 85-90% Fe₃O₄, 8-12% Cr₂O₃, 1-2% CuO promoter, extrudate or pellets 4-8mm, 15-40 m³ bed volume, 15-40 tonnes). Operating: 320-450°C inlet (cool secondary reformer effluent from 1,000°C to 350-400°C in waste heat boiler, generate 100-120 bar steam), exit 380-480°C (exothermic reaction heats gas 30-80°C, depends on CO conversion). Pressure: 25-35 bar. Residence time: 2-5 seconds (space velocity 2,000-5,000 h⁻¹). **Performance:** CO conversion: 70-85% (12% CO → 3-4% CO, equilibrium limited, 350-400°C equilibrium favors 90-95% but kinetics require higher temperature, compromise). Exit gas: H₂ 70-72%, N₂ 22-24%, CO 3-5%, CO₂ 10-13%, Ar 0.5%, CH₄ 0.2%, H₂O 1-2% (most water consumed or condensed). **Catalyst lifetime:** 5-10 years (deactivates by sintering at high temperature, sulfur poisoning if desulfurization fails <0.1 ppm tolerance, chloride poisoning <1 ppm Cl). Regeneration: not practical (replaced). **Heat recovery:** Exit gas (400-480°C) generates medium-pressure steam (40-60 bar, economizer, 10-30 MW thermal).

**Step 83-105: Low-Temperature Shift (LTS) - Final CO Reduction**
Further reduce CO to <0.3% (ammonia synthesis catalyst Fe tolerance <10 ppm CO, LTS essential). **LTS reactor:** Vertical vessel, 2-3m diameter, 5-10m tall, carbon steel (no refractory, operates 180-250°C, lower temperature than HTS). Catalyst: copper-zinc oxide-alumina (CuO-ZnO-Al₂O₃, 30-40% CuO, 30-40% ZnO, 15-25% Al₂O₃, tablets or extrudates 4-6mm, 10-25 m³ bed volume). Active catalyst: metallic Cu⁰ (reduced in-situ during startup, CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O, carefully controlled 150-200°C, exothermic, risk of sintering if overheated). **Operating conditions:** Inlet 190-250°C (cool HTS effluent, heat exchangers), exit 200-260°C (exothermic, 10-30°C temperature rise, less than HTS because lower CO concentration, smaller ΔH total). Pressure: 25-35 bar. Residence time: 3-8 seconds (lower space velocity than HTS, 1,000-2,000 h⁻¹, more time for equilibrium). **Performance:** CO conversion: 80-95% (3-4% CO → 0.2-0.4% CO, exit CO 0.2-0.5%, equilibrium at 200-250°C favors 98-99.5% conversion). Exit gas: H₂ 72-74%, N₂ 23-24%, CO 0.2-0.4%, CO₂ 11-14%, Ar 0.5%, CH₄ 0.2%, H₂O <0.5%. **Catalyst sensitivity:** Highly sensitive to poisons: sulfur (<0.1 ppm, forms CuS, irreversible), chlorides (<0.5 ppm, Cu volatilization as CuCl₂ above 250°C), liquid water (condenses below dew point ~50-80°C, oxidizes Cu⁰ → CuO, leaches Zn, mechanical damage from thermal shock). Catalyst life: 3-7 years (shorter than HTS, replaced more frequently, cost $200-500k per charge). **Heat recovery:** Exit gas cools to 30-50°C (generate low-pressure steam 3-6 bar, or preheat boiler feedwater).

**Step 106-128: CO₂ Removal - Amine Scrubbing**
Remove carbon dioxide (30-35% of gas volume by now, inert in ammonia synthesis, reduces efficiency, must remove to <500 ppm). **Absorption tower (absorber):** Vertical column, 2-5m diameter, 20-40m tall, carbon steel, packed or trayed. Packing: structured packing (Mellapak, Flexipac, metal or plastic, high surface area 200-500 m²/m³, low pressure drop) or random packing (Pall rings, Raschig rings, 25-50mm, older designs). Lean amine enters top (25-35°C, 100-200 g/L CO₂ loading), flows downward (gravity, wets packing). Process gas enters bottom (30-50°C, 25-35 bar), flows upward (countercurrent, intimate contact with amine). **Amine solution:** Monoethanolamine (MEA, H₂NCH₂CH₂OH, 15-30 wt% in water) or methyldiethanolamine (MDEA, CH₃N(CH₂CH₂OH)₂, 40-50 wt%, less corrosive, lower regeneration energy). Reaction: CO₂ + 2RNH₂ ⇌ RNH₃⁺ + RNHCOO⁻ (carbamate formation, reversible, exothermic ΔH = -80 kJ/mol CO₂). Also: CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃ (carbonic acid), H₂CO₃ + RNH₂ ⇌ RNH₃⁺ + HCO₃⁻ (bicarbonate, slower, MDEA pathway). **Absorption performance:** Scrub CO₂ from 12-14% to <0.05% (<500 ppm, ammonia synthesis spec). Rich amine exits bottom (CO₂ loading 400-500 g/L, capacity 0.4-0.5 mol CO₂/mol amine MEA, 0.6-0.7 MDEA). Treated gas exits top (H₂ 73-75%, N₂ 24-25%, Ar 0.5%, CO 0.2-0.3%, CO₂ <0.05%, CH₄ 0.2%, saturated with water vapor). Pressure drop: 0.1-0.5 bar. **Corrosion:** CO₂-amine-water system is corrosive (carbon steel corrodes 0.1-0.5 mm/year, add corrosion inhibitors sodium vanadate or phosphate, 0.1-0.5% concentration, or use stainless steel 304/316 in high-stress areas).

**Step 129-148: Amine Regeneration and Recycle**
Regenerate amine: strip CO₂, recycle lean amine. **Stripper column (regenerator):** Vertical column, 1.5-3m diameter, 15-30m tall, carbon steel, trayed or packed. Rich amine enters top (400-500 g/L CO₂, 40-60°C), flows down through trays/packing, heated by rising steam. Reboiler at bottom: kettle or thermosiphon type, heat with low-pressure steam (3-6 bar, 140-160°C) or hot oil. Boil water + desorb CO₂: temperature 100-120°C, pressure 1.5-2.5 bar (slightly above atmospheric, prevent air ingress). Reaction reverses: RNH₃⁺ + RNHCOO⁻ → CO₂ + 2RNH₂ (endothermic, ΔH = +80 kJ/mol, heat required). **Overhead:** CO₂ + water vapor exits top, condenses in reflux condenser (cooling water 25-35°C), liquid water returns to column (reflux, washes amine mist), CO₂ gas vents (98-99% CO₂, <1% H₂O, vent to atmosphere or capture if CCS facility). Flow: 0.4-0.5 tonnes CO₂ per tonne NH₃ (from SMR + WGS reactions, carbon balance: 1 mol CH₄ → 0.5-0.7 mol CO₂ to atmosphere, 0.3-0.5 mol CO₂ from combustion fuel). **Lean amine:** Exits reboiler (100-120°C, CO₂ loading 50-100 g/L, lean loading 10-20% of rich, 90-95% regeneration efficiency). Cool in heat exchanger: rich/lean exchanger (heat integration, preheat rich amine with hot lean, 60-80% heat recovery, reduces reboiler duty). Then cooler (cooling water, 25-35°C). Pump back to absorber (centrifugal pump, 30-40 bar, overcome pressure + elevation). Makeup amine: 0.5-2 kg/tonne NH₃ (losses to venting, degradation, corrosion products filtration). **Energy:** Reboiler duty 3-4 GJ/tonne CO₂ removed (MEA, 2-3 GJ/tonne MDEA, 40-60 GJ/tonne NH₃ plant thermal energy for regeneration, 10-15% of total plant energy).

**Step 149-168: Methanation - Trace CO/CO₂ Removal**
Remove final traces of carbon oxides (<500 ppm CO₂, <3,000 ppm CO after amine, must reduce to <10 ppm combined, iron catalyst poisoning). **Methanation reactor:** Horizontal or vertical vessel, 1-2m diameter, 3-6m long/tall, carbon steel, refractory-lined or insulated. Catalyst: nickel on alumina or nickel on silica-alumina (15-30% Ni, pellets or rings 3-6mm, 2-6 m³ bed volume, 2-5 tonnes). Reactions: CO + 3H₂ → CH₄ + H₂O (ΔH = -206 kJ/mol, strongly exothermic), CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O (ΔH = -165 kJ/mol, exothermic). Convert trace CO/CO₂ to methane (harmless to ammonia catalyst, inert). **Operating conditions:** Preheat gas to 250-350°C (recuperative heat exchanger or electric heater). Pass through catalyst bed: inlet 250-350°C, exit 300-400°C (exothermic, temperature rise 30-80°C depends on CO/CO₂ concentration, typically 40-60°C rise for 0.3% CO + 0.05% CO₂). Pressure: 25-35 bar. Residence time: 0.5-2 seconds. **Performance:** CO + CO₂ conversion >99.9% (exit <5 ppm CO, <5 ppm CO₂, typically <2 ppm each, detection limit of analyzers). Gas composition: H₂ 74-75%, N₂ 24-25%, Ar 0.5-0.6%, CH₄ 0.3-0.4% (includes original CH₄ slip + methanation product). Water vapor: 0.1-0.3% (from methanation, condenses in subsequent cooling). **Catalyst life:** 5-15 years (robust, less sensitive than shift catalysts, deactivates by sulfur <0.05 ppm, sintering, carbon formation if CO/CO₂ too high >2% causes coking). **Final drying:** Cool gas to 0-10°C (knockout drum, condense water), then molecular sieve dryer or refrigeration dryer (remove H₂O to <1 ppm dew point -60°C, prevent water entering compressor/synthesis loop, ice formation in refrigeration heat exchangers).

**Step 169-185: [Synthesis Gas Compression](centrifugal-compressor) to Reaction Pressure**
Compress syngas from 25-35 bar to 150-250 bar (synthesis pressure). **Syngas compressor:** Centrifugal (large plants, >1,000 tonne/day NH₃) or reciprocating (smaller plants, high pressure). Centrifugal: 3-5 stages (barrel type or integrally geared, discharge pressure 150-250 bar, driven by steam turbine 25-60 MW or electric motor). Reciprocating: 3-4 stages with intercooling (horizontal or vertical, double-acting pistons, 200-300 bar discharge, electric motor or steam engine). **Centrifugal details:** First stage: suction 25-35 bar, discharge 60-80 bar, flow 80,000-120,000 Nm³/h (fresh syngas + recycle, 5-6× recycle ratio means compressor handles 400,000-600,000 Nm³/h total). Second stage: 60-80 bar to 110-140 bar. Third stage: 110-140 bar to 160-220 bar. Optional fourth/fifth stages for 250+ bar (older plants, modern trend 150-180 bar, lower pressure reduces compression energy, better catalyst activity). **Intercooling:** Cool between stages to 30-45°C (water-cooled shell-and-tube heat exchangers, 20-40 MW heat rejection per stage). Knockout drums: separate condensed water + ammonia (traces of NH₃ slip from recycle loop, 10-50 ppm, condenses, remove to prevent buildup). **Driver:** Steam turbine preferred (use high-pressure steam 100-120 bar generated in primary reformer, secondary reformer waste heat boilers, exothermic shift/methanation/synthesis heat recovery, integrated energy balance, turbine exhaust steam 3-6 bar for amine reboiler + other heating, 35-40% of plant steam powers compressor, major energy integration). Electric motor: 30-50 MW (if steam unavailable, direct grid connection, synchronous motor 3-20 kV). **Power consumption:** 30-50 MW for 1,500 tonne/day plant (20-33 kW per tonne NH₃, 18-30 kWh/tonne including drive inefficiencies, largest single electrical/mechanical consumer in plant).

**Step 186-195: Final Purification and Feed to Synthesis**
Remove final impurities before synthesis. **Liquid nitrogen wash (optional, high-purity plants):** Cool compressed syngas to -30°C to -50°C (ammonia refrigeration cycle or liquid nitrogen from cryogenic plant). Condense traces of water, methane, argon (heavier components at cryogenic temperature and high pressure). Purified syngas: H₂ 74.5-75%, N₂ 24.8-25%, Ar <0.2% (reduced from 0.5%, improves synthesis efficiency, less purge loss). **Deoxygenation (rare, if trace O₂):** Palladium or platinum catalyst bed, catalytic recombination: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O (removes O₂ <0.1 ppm, critical, O₂ oxidizes iron catalyst). **Final analysis:** Online analyzers (thermal conductivity detector TCD for H₂, paramagnetic for O₂, IR for CO/CO₂, gas chromatograph GC for Ar/CH₄/N₂). Specification: H₂ 74-75%, N₂ 24.5-25%, Ar <0.5%, CH₄ <0.5%, CO + CO₂ <10 ppm, O₂ <0.1 ppm, H₂O <1 ppm (dew point -60°C). H₂:N₂ ratio: 2.95-3.05:1 (critical, off-ratio reduces conversion, excess H₂ or N₂ accumulates in recycle, increases purge loss, ratio control via air injection to secondary reformer ±2% trim). **Feed to synthesis loop:** Syngas combines with recycle gas (unreacted H₂ + N₂ from separator, 4-6× recycle ratio means fresh syngas 15-20% of total loop flow, 80-85% recycle, total loop flow 400,000-600,000 Nm³/h for 1,500 tonne/day plant).

Price: $0.40/kg ($400/tonne) represents average ammonia selling price (2020-2024). Used in: fertilizers (urea 45%, ammonium nitrate 20%, ammonium phosphate 10%, direct application 5%, total 80%), chemicals (nitric acid for adipic acid/TDI/explosives 8%, acrylonitrile for acrylic fibers 2%, sodium cyanide for gold mining 1%, caprolactam for nylon-6 1%, other organics 2%, total 14%), industrial refrigeration (anhydrous NH₃, food processing, ice rinks, cold storage, 3%), semiconductor cleaning (ammonium hydroxide SC-1 clean, TMAH development, nitrogen source, 1%), explosives (ammonium nitrate ANFO mining, military, 1%), other (NOx reduction SCR, water treatment, 1%). Per tonne urea: 0.57 tonnes NH₃ → $228 ammonia cost. Volatile commodity: price $200-900/tonne (2010-2024 range, tracks natural gas, fertilizer demand, geopolitics, 2021-2022 energy crisis peak $1,400/tonne Europe).
