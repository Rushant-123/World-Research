## Process Notes

The plastic speaker frame injection molding process combines precision material handling, advanced insert molding technology, and rigorous quality control to produce components meeting strict acoustic and dimensional requirements. The 20% glass fiber reinforcement provides necessary structural rigidity while maintaining the acoustic properties required for speaker applications. Critical success factors include precise temperature control throughout the barrel zones, optimal holding pressure to prevent sink marks, and accurate terminal insert positioning for subsequent electrical assembly. The process capability achieved through statistical process control ensures consistent dimensional accuracy within ±0.1mm tolerances required for acoustic performance and assembly fit.
