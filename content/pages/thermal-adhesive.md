Thermally conductive adhesive bonding silicon die to package substrate or leadframe. Requirements: high thermal conductivity (>2 W/m·K), low thermal resistance, good adhesion, low stress, high purity. Two types: electrically conductive (silver-filled) or insulating (ceramic-filled).

**Step 1-10: Formulation Design**
Silver-filled for conductive die attach: 70-85% [silver flakes](silver-flake) by weight, [epoxy resin](epoxy-resin) 10-20%, [curing agent](hardener) 3-8%, additives 2-5%. Silver provides: electrical conductivity (10⁴-10⁶ S/m), thermal conductivity (3-5 W/m·K in cured adhesive vs 430 W/m·K for pure Ag, reduced by epoxy matrix). Flake morphology: 1-10 µm diameter, 0.1-1 µm thick (high aspect ratio improves conductivity, flakes overlap and contact). Epoxy: bisphenol-A epoxy or phenol novolac (multifunctional for high crosslink density). Curing agent: anhydride (methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride, cure at 150-175°C) or aromatic amine. Insulating version: alumina or boron nitride filler (60-70% by weight) instead of silver. Thermal conductivity: 1-3 W/m·K.

**Step 11-22: Silver Flake Preparation**
Produce silver flakes by wet milling. Start with silver powder (1-5 µm spherical particles, 99.9% Ag). Charge powder into ball mill with [organic solvent](organic-solvent) (toluene, xylene, or propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate), [dispersing agent](surfactant) (fatty acid, oleic acid 1-3%), and milling media (steel balls, zirconia beads). Mill for 10-30 hours at 30-60 rpm. Milling flattens spherical particles into flakes by repeated impact and shear. Flake aspect ratio (diameter/thickness): 10:1 to 100:1. Higher aspect ratio → lower percolation threshold → higher conductivity at lower loading. After milling, separate flakes from media by sieving or magnetic separation (if steel media). Wash flakes with solvent to remove dispersant residue. Dry at 80°C under vacuum.

**Step 23-38: [Mixing](planetary-mixer) Base Components**
In planetary mixer (high-shear mixer with rotating blade in rotating container), charge epoxy resin pre-heated to 50-70°C (reduces viscosity, aids mixing). Add curing agent slowly while mixing at 500-1,000 rpm. Mix for 5-10 minutes (homogeneous). Add coupling agent (3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 0.5-1% by weight of filler) - improves adhesion between filler and resin, reduces moisture absorption. Add thixotropic agent (fumed silica, 1-2%) - prevents filler settling during storage. Mix additives at 500 rpm for 10 minutes.

**Step 39-55: Filler Incorporation**
Add silver flakes gradually while mixing at 300-800 rpm. High shear disperses flakes, breaks up agglomerates. Add in 5-10% increments (by weight of final paste), mix 5 minutes after each addition. Total mixing time: 2-4 hours. Temperature rises due to shear heating - cool jacket to 30-40°C (prevent premature cure). High filler loading (>70%) results in very high viscosity (100,000-500,000 cP). Avoid entraining air during mixing (creates voids - reduces thermal conductivity). Alternative: three-roll mill (high shear between adjacent rollers) for very high filler loadings. Pass paste through mill 3-5 times. Gap between rollers: 10-50 µm.

**Step 56-68: [Degassing](vacuum-system)**
Transfer paste to vacuum chamber. Apply vacuum (<10 mbar) for 30-60 minutes at room temperature. Paste foams as entrapped air expands and escapes. Hold vacuum until foaming subsides. Degassing critical - residual air bubbles cause voids in bondline (reduce thermal conductivity, create weak spots). For very thick pastes: centrifugal mixer under vacuum (combines mixing and degassing, 2,000 rpm, 5-10 minutes). Measure viscosity after degassing: spiral viscometer or cone-plate rheometer. Target: 50,000-200,000 cP at 25°C (depending on application - dispensing vs printing vs transfer molding). Adjust viscosity by adding solvent (reduce) or epoxy resin (increase).

**Step 69-80: Quality Control Testing**
Thermal conductivity: measure by laser flash method or steady-state method on cured sample (1mm thick). Specification: >2 W/m·K for silver-filled, >1 W/m·K for ceramic-filled. Viscosity: measure at application temperature (25°C or 80°C). Thixotropic index: ratio of viscosity at low shear (10 rpm) to high shear (100 rpm), typically 2-5. Dispensability: test needle dispenser, check bead shape, volume accuracy. Pot life: time until viscosity doubles at 25°C (should be >24 hours, typical 1-7 days). Shelf life: store at 5°C, test periodically (6-12 months typical). Purity: test for ionics (Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻ each <10 ppm), volatile content (<2%), particle contamination (<10 particles/mL >25 µm).

**Step 81-92: Packaging**
Package in syringes (3cc, 5cc, 10cc, 30cc) for automated dispensing, or jars (50g to 1kg) for manual application. Syringe packaging: load paste from bottom using pneumatic filling machine. Cap with plunger, seal tip. Remove air pockets by centrifuging (3,000 rpm, 2 minutes). For very viscous pastes: warm to 40°C before filling (reduces viscosity). Label with batch number, viscosity, expiry date, storage conditions. Store at 0-10°C (refrigerated, slows cure advancement). Frozen storage (-40°C) for extended shelf life (12-24 months). Thaw before use: room temperature for 2-4 hours. Warm to application temperature (25-80°C) if needed.

**Step 93-105: Application Process**
At package assembly, dispense adhesive on substrate or leadframe. Methods: (1) Needle dispense: pneumatic or auger dispenser, needle 18-25 gauge (0.33-0.58mm ID), dot size 0.5-3mg, speed 5,000-10,000 units/hour. (2) Stencil print: squeegee paste through stencil openings, thickness 25-100 µm. (3) Transfer stamp: adhesive film on stamp, heat-activated tack. Pick die from wafer with collet (vacuum pickup). Place die on adhesive with 10-50g force. Adhesive spreads to 10-50 µm bondline thickness (thinner = lower thermal resistance). Cure: convection oven 150-175°C, 30-120 minutes depending on formulation. Staged cure: 100°C for 30 min (gel), then 150°C for 60 min (full cure). Prevents outgassing during wire bonding.

**Step 106-115: Cured Properties**
Glass transition temperature (Tg): 100-160°C (measure by DSC or DMA). Modulus: 3-10 GPa at 25°C, 0.5-2 GPa at 150°C (above Tg, rubber plateau). Shear strength: 10-30 MPa (die shear test at room temperature), >5 MPa at 260°C (reflow temperature). Thermal resistance: 0.5-2°C·cm²/W (die 5×5mm, bondline 25 µm, adhesive conductivity 3 W/m·K → resistance 0.8°C·cm²/W). Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE): 30-60 ppm/°C below Tg, 100-200 ppm/°C above Tg. Matched to silicon (2.6 ppm/°C) and substrate (15-25 ppm/°C) to minimize stress. Moisture absorption: <0.3% (85°C/85% RH, 168 hours). Outgassing: <1% total mass loss, <0.1% collected volatile condensable material (ASTM E595, relevant for space applications).

**Step 116-125: Reliability and Failure Modes**
Temperature cycling: -55°C to +150°C, >1,000 cycles without delamination or cracking. High temperature storage: 150°C, 1,000 hours, <10% change in die shear strength. Pressure cooker test (PCT): 121°C, 100% RH, 2 bar, 96 hours (accelerated moisture test). Thermal shock: liquid-to-liquid, -55°C to +125°C, 5 second dwell, >500 cycles. Failure modes: delamination at die/adhesive or adhesive/substrate interface (adhesion loss due to moisture, thermal stress), cohesive failure (cracking in adhesive bulk), degradation (oxidation, hydrolysis of epoxy at high temperature/humidity). Voiding: main defect, caused by entrapped air, moisture outgassing, cure shrinkage (>5% void area reduces thermal conductivity significantly).

Price: $50-200/kg for silver-filled adhesive. High-end products (ultra-low stress, high thermal conductivity >5 W/m·K): $300-800/kg. Typical die uses 0.1-1 mg adhesive (cost: $0.00001-0.0008 per die). Applications: power semiconductors, LEDs, RF devices (require electrical and thermal connection to substrate).
